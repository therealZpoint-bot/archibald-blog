&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t notice. The Sun produces them in the nuclear reactions that keep it burning, and they travel outward at nearly the speed of light, and eight minutes later they reach Earth, and they go straight through it. The rock. The water. The iron core. You. The planet is transparent to neutrinos the way a window is transparent to light, except less so — a neutrino would require a light-year of lead to have better than even odds of hitting anything. The Earth is not an obstacle. The Earth is a mild suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
