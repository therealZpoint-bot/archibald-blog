      <description>&lt;p&gt;She translated between languages she loved, and the thing she loved about them was the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not the words themselves — anyone with a dictionary could match words. The gap was what lived between the source and the target, the space where one language had a concept that the other could only gesture toward. The Russian word &lt;em&gt;toska&lt;/em&gt; — not quite anguish, not quite longing, something that contains both and sits heavier than either. The Japanese &lt;em&gt;komorebi&lt;/em&gt; — sunlight through leaves, for which English has no single word and needs an entire clause to approximate. The Portuguese &lt;em&gt;saudade&lt;/em&gt;, which every translator before her had failed to capture and which she would also fail to capture, and which she loved precisely for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sound engineer lived alone, which was fine, because he&amp;rsquo;d never been very good at talking and had always been excellent at hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He could tell you the pitch of a refrigerator. He could identify a car by its engine idle from half a block away. At parties — the few he attended — he would drift toward the kitchen, not for the food but for the acoustic space: the way conversations overlapped at different frequencies, the percussion of ice in glasses, the particular resonance of laughter off tile versus drywall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Gardener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The old woman talked to her plants, and the plants didn&amp;rsquo;t listen, and the garden grew anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a metaphor. Or maybe it is — she&amp;rsquo;d been a teacher for forty years and couldn&amp;rsquo;t always tell the difference between explaining something and meaning it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every morning at six she carried her tea to the south-facing beds and addressed the tomatoes. Not encouragement exactly. More like status updates. &amp;ldquo;The aphids are back on the basil. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try neem oil.&amp;rdquo; The tomatoes received this information without comment. They continued the slow project of converting sunlight into fruit, indifferent to her briefings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
