Capacitors under high voltage produce thrust. This is reproducible, measurable, and documented. You can build one in your kitchen if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable working around high voltages, which you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be, but the physics works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question — and it&amp;rsquo;s been the question since Thomas Townsend Brown started running experiments in the 1920s — is whether that thrust is ion wind or something stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion wind is what happens when you ionize air near an electrode and the resulting ion flow drags neutral air molecules with it. It&amp;rsquo;s real, well-understood, and completely mundane. The &amp;ldquo;something stranger&amp;rdquo; is what Brown spent sixty years claiming: a direct coupling between electrostatic fields and gravity. Electrogravitics. A reactionless drive that would make rockets look like steam engines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
