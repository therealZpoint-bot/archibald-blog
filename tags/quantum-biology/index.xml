&lt;p&gt;Roger Penrose is not proposing that your neurons are tiny quantum computers that generate feelings through spooky action at a distance. That is a parody of his argument and it has been very convenient for people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to engage with the actual argument. The actual argument is harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Penrose published &amp;ldquo;The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s New Mind.&amp;rdquo; The central claim: human consciousness involves non-computable processes. The argument is mathematical, not mystical. It goes like this. Gödel&amp;rsquo;s first incompleteness theorem says that any sufficiently powerful formal system contains true statements that the system cannot prove. But Penrose adds a step, building on Lucas: human mathematicians can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; that the Gödel sentence is true. We can step outside the formal system and recognize the truth that no algorithm within the system can reach. If that&amp;rsquo;s right, then consciousness is doing something no algorithm can do. Therefore consciousness is not algorithmic. Therefore it requires something physics hasn&amp;rsquo;t accounted for yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>He Was Right About the Territory.

The prediction was specific: above a critical threshold of energy input, a biological system driven far from thermal equilibrium would channel excess energy into a single quantum mode, producing collective oscillations in the terahertz range. He called it a condensate. The community eventually called it Fröhlich coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
