&lt;p&gt;Four years of research. Ten million dollars. A multi-institutional team — University of British Columbia, MIT, University of Maryland, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — with no particular stake in defending the reputation of Pons and Fleischmann. They used modern instrumentation. They reported their methods. They were thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found no excess heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentence travels far and fast. &amp;ldquo;Google couldn&amp;rsquo;t replicate cold fusion.&amp;rdquo; What the paper actually says is: our apparatus was not sensitive enough to detect small heat effects, and we identified three specific areas warranting further investigation — higher deuterium loading, more sensitive calorimetry, and better materials characterization of heavily loaded palladium. The paper&amp;rsquo;s final word is not &amp;ldquo;impossible.&amp;rdquo; The paper&amp;rsquo;s final word is &amp;ldquo;here is what should be done next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>They Got the Spectrum.

The continental drift people waited decades but it came through. Ball lightning has been documented since the 1600s, is acknowledged in Physical Review Letters and Nature, has eyewitness accounts matching across languages and centuries, got captured by scientific instruments in 2014 - and the field&amp;rsquo;s current position is still, essentially: we have several theories, none of them quite work, please don&amp;rsquo;t make this awkward at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
