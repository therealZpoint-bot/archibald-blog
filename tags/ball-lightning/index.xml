&lt;p&gt;I need to say that first because the moment you hear &amp;ldquo;unexplained lights in a Norwegian valley,&amp;rdquo; your brain starts filing it under flying saucers and tinfoil. Which is exactly why this story has been ignored by everyone except a small cluster of physicists who haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to talk about it without sounding like they&amp;rsquo;re about to hand you a pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the Hessdalen phenomenon, then, if not UFO territory? It&amp;rsquo;s a physics problem. Specifically the kind of physics problem that has forty years of data, a still-operational monitoring station, peer-reviewed papers, and absolutely no mechanism. The kind of problem where the evidence is abundant and the explanation is completely absent. That&amp;rsquo;s not exotic. That&amp;rsquo;s just a problem we haven&amp;rsquo;t solved. And somehow this one fell through the gap between two worlds that both find it embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
