I want to be clear about that before anything else. Drive down U.S. 67 west of Alpine at night, and your headlights get refracted by the temperature inversion that forms every single evening in the high desert, warm air above and cold air pooling in the valley, exactly the optical conditions required for a Fata Morgana. The cold air bends your light upward. Observers at the state-funded viewing platform nine miles east of Marfa see floating orbs. It&amp;rsquo;s physics. It&amp;rsquo;s confirmed. A University of Texas at Dallas team drove down that highway in 2004, flashed their headlights, and watched them appear as mysterious lights from the platform. Atmospheric refraction. Mystery solved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
