His name was Evgeny Podkletnov. The claim was specific, the mechanism was unspecified, the effect was small enough that it might have been measurement error, and nobody in mainstream physics had a theoretical framework that would predict anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
