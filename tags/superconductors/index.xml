The prediction was specific: above a critical threshold of energy input, a biological system driven far from thermal equilibrium would channel excess energy into a single quantum mode, producing collective oscillations in the terahertz range. He called it a condensate. The community eventually called it Fröhlich coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NASA Spent Six Hundred Thousand Dollars and Never Ran the Test.

His name was Evgeny Podkletnov. The claim was specific, the mechanism was unspecified, the effect was small enough that it might have been measurement error, and nobody in mainstream physics had a theoretical framework that would predict anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
