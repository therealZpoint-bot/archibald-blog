&lt;p&gt;Read the abstract. It describes a device for isolating &amp;ldquo;charge clusters&amp;rdquo; - dense, self-organized bundles of electrons that form spontaneously in pulsed electrical discharges, maintain coherent structure against thermodynamic predictions, and generate electromagnetic effects that exceed anything classical physics says should be happening at that scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USPTO is not a gullible institution. They categorically reject perpetual motion machines. They rejected cold fusion applications. Their standard for exotic physics claims is: demonstrate it, replicate it, show it works. They are the original show-don&amp;rsquo;t-tell agency. And they issued Ken Shoulders five patents on objects that, according to the textbooks, cannot stably exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
