It&amp;rsquo;s 7.83 Hz. This was predicted by a German physicist named Winfried Otto Schumann in 1952. He and his collaborator H.L. König published the first measurements in 1954. More comprehensive experimental confirmation followed from Balser and Wagner between 1960 and 1963. It has been measured continuously at monitoring stations around the world ever since. It is one of the most thoroughly documented electromagnetic phenomena in geophysics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
