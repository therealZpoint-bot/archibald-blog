The Dirac equation predicts the magnetic moment of the electron to 12 decimal places. The Standard Model has been confirmed to parts per trillion. No theory has been more precisely validated by experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this tells you what happens when you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wavefunction collapse problem &amp;ndash; what occurs when a quantum system is measured &amp;ndash; has been unresolved since Heisenberg in 1927. Not unresolved as in &amp;ldquo;partially understood, more work needed.&amp;rdquo; Unresolved as in: physicists actively disagree about whether anything happens at all, whether the word &amp;ldquo;happens&amp;rdquo; is even applicable, and whether asking the question constitutes legitimate physics or the kind of philosophy they agreed to stop doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
