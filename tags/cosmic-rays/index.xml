Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. The Fly&amp;rsquo;s Eye detector recorded a cosmic ray event at approximately 3.2 times 10^20 electron volts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me put that in units your nervous system can actually process. What does 3.2 times 10^20 electron volts mean to a human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single proton arrived at Earth&amp;rsquo;s upper atmosphere carrying the kinetic energy of a baseball moving at ninety kilometers per hour. One proton. One subatomic particle. Baseball-throw energy, concentrated in a thing smaller than thought. It hit the atmosphere and the atmosphere won, obviously. The proton annihilated into a cascade of secondary particles that spread across a square kilometer of Utah desert before anything could catch it. But for the duration of its approach, that proton existed. It was real. It came from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
