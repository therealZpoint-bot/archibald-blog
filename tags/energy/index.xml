Not the science - the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 23, 1989. Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons stand in front of cameras at the University of Utah and announce they&amp;rsquo;ve achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature. In a glass jar. With palladium electrodes and heavy water. The physics establishment&amp;rsquo;s reaction landed somewhere between &amp;ldquo;excuse me?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how dare you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody cracks down on a failed experiment. What they cracked down on was the venue. You don&amp;rsquo;t announce nuclear fusion without peer review. You don&amp;rsquo;t do it at a press conference. You don&amp;rsquo;t do it before independent replication is in. These were genuine violations of genuine norms and the physics community had a real point.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
