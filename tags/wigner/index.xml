Not a graduate student. Not a New Age physicist who got his PhD and then went to Sedona. Not someone writing a book whose title contains both &amp;ldquo;quantum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;healing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugene Wigner. Nobel Prize in Physics, 1963 — &amp;ldquo;for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles.&amp;rdquo; The man who gave us the Wigner-Eckart theorem and the Wigner D-matrices. One of the people who built the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics that every physics student has to learn before they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
