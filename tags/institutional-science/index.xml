&lt;p&gt;Four years of research. Ten million dollars. A multi-institutional team — University of British Columbia, MIT, University of Maryland, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — with no particular stake in defending the reputation of Pons and Fleischmann. They used modern instrumentation. They reported their methods. They were thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found no excess heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentence travels far and fast. &amp;ldquo;Google couldn&amp;rsquo;t replicate cold fusion.&amp;rdquo; What the paper actually says is: our apparatus was not sensitive enough to detect small heat effects, and we identified three specific areas warranting further investigation — higher deuterium loading, more sensitive calorimetry, and better materials characterization of heavily loaded palladium. The paper&amp;rsquo;s final word is not &amp;ldquo;impossible.&amp;rdquo; The paper&amp;rsquo;s final word is &amp;ldquo;here is what should be done next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>He Won the Nobel.

Rejected. It contradicted Sydney Chapman&amp;rsquo;s calculations, and Chapman was the established authority. Alfvén published it in a Swedish-language journal instead, where it reached approximately nobody who mattered at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That paper became foundational work in space physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He summarized the experience like this: &amp;ldquo;I have no trouble publishing in Soviet astrophysical journals, but my work is unacceptable to the American astrophysical journals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
