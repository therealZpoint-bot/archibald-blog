They did.</em></p><hr><p>There is a bubble of air at the center of a glass flask. Someone turns on a speaker. It expands — swells to fifty microns, about half the width of a human hair. Then the acoustic wave flips. The pressure outside reverses. The atmosphere decides it&rsquo;s done being polite.</p><p>What happens next takes less than a nanosecond.</p><p>The bubble collapses. Not &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; like a tent in wind. Collapses like a star going supernova in reverse. The radius drops from fifty microns to one micron. The surface moves faster than the speed of sound. When it hits the hard-core repulsion of the gas molecules and can&rsquo;t go any further, the interior has reached seventy thousand Kelvin.</p><p>The surface of the sun is five thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight Kelvin.</p><p>It is twelve times hotter than the surface of the sun. For fifty picoseconds — fifty trillionths of a second — there is a tiny star in your water glass. Then it emits a flash of mostly ultraviolet light and starts bouncing. The speaker fires it again. This happens forty thousand times per second.</p><p>Do they teach this in high school physics? No. Do they mention it in introductory thermodynamics? Also no. Is it in the standard curriculum anywhere between kindergarten and a physics PhD? It is not. But it&rsquo;s real, documented, and reproducible with a home stereo and a flask from the chemistry lab.</p><p>They call this sonoluminescence. Sound into light. The mechanism is not fully understood.</p><hr><p>In 1934, at the University of Cologne, two German scientists named H. Frenzel and H. Schultes were working with sonar equipment left over from World War I. They noticed that strong sound fields in water did strange things to bubbles. The bubbles glowed. They measured it, wrote it up, explained the light emission in terms of <em>Reibungselektrizität</em> — frictional electricity. Like shoes on a carpet.</p><p>Then they concluded their paper by noting that they had more important matters to attend to.</p><p>It was 1934. Germany. You can fill in the rest.</p><p>The phenomenon sat in the literature. Chemists noticed it occasionally, couldn&rsquo;t characterize it properly because the bubbles were chaotic — clouds of them, all flashing at different times, impossible to measure. Documented, noted, filed under &ldquo;interesting but inconvenient.&rdquo;</p><p>Fifty years later, Seth Putterman at UCLA heard about it over coffee from a colleague. His first reaction was that he did not believe it was possible.</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t he believe it? Because he was a physicist and his intuition said sound doesn&rsquo;t make light. Sound makes pressure waves and eventually headaches. Light is a different department.</p><p>He went to check. He was wrong.</p><hr><p>Here is how Putterman&rsquo;s lab built their setup to investigate a phenomenon that supposedly doesn&rsquo;t exist: a boiling flask from the chemistry lab. An oscilloscope from the undergraduate lab. His home stereo. A photomultiplier tube he bought with his own credit card.</p><p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s what you need to create conditions that Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory spends hundreds of millions of dollars trying to replicate with giant lasers.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s what makes it stranger: the single-bubble version — one bubble, trapped at the center of the flask by the sound field, pulsing like a heartbeat — is more regular than a quartz clock. The timing between flashes varies by no more than fifty picoseconds. You want precision? A collapsing sphere gives you precision that embarrasses mechanical clockwork.</p><p>The flashes are too brief to measure with ordinary photodetectors. You need the fastest sensors in the world. The sensors that high-energy physicists use to catch particle collisions aren&rsquo;t fast enough.</p><p>Why isn&rsquo;t this famous? Why don&rsquo;t people know that you can make something twelve times hotter than the surface of the sun with a speaker? That&rsquo;s the kind of thing that should end up on the front page, in the public imagination, in the list of &ldquo;things that will blow your mind.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s in the back pages of physics.</p><hr><p>Here is the part that breaks your head.</p><p>Air is roughly seventy-eight percent nitrogen and twenty-one percent oxygen. That last one percent is mostly argon, a noble gas that doesn&rsquo;t react with anything, goes nowhere, does nothing. You could be forgiven for calling it atmospheric padding.</p><p>Putterman&rsquo;s lab degassed their water and replaced the air with pure gases to see what worked. Pure nitrogen bubble: almost no light. Pure oxygen bubble: barely anything. A mix of nitrogen and oxygen — which is, again, ninety-nine percent of air — also dim. Gas from a commercial liquid-air canister, from which the argon has been removed: still dim.</p><p>They panicked. Rechecked the equipment. The measurements were fine.</p><p>They added argon back. It worked.</p><p>They tried other noble gases. Helium: works. Xenon: works. Each produces a different spectrum but all produce sonoluminescence. But why? Why does the one percent of chemically inert, nonreactive gas that does nothing, contribute anything? Why is there an optimal concentration of about one percent — not zero point one percent, not five percent, but approximately one percent — at which the response peaks?</p><p>Nobody knows. This has been established for at least thirty years. Nobody knows why the argon does it.</p><p>The mechanism by which a noble gas that has no chemical interactions with anything around it turns a dim collapse into a plasma event: unknown. Unknown, but repeatable. You can build it yourself. The universe is doing something it won&rsquo;t explain.</p><hr><p>Lord Rayleigh almost predicted all of this in 1917. The Royal Navy hired him to figure out why ship propellers were degrading. He determined that cavitating bubbles — air pockets created as the propeller sliced through water — were collapsing onto the metal with enormous force. He did the mathematics of a collapsing bubble. He was almost right.</p><p>His error: he assumed the collapse was isothermal. Temperature stays constant, pressure changes, gas obeys Boyle&rsquo;s Law. Standard thermodynamics, reasonable assumption, completely wrong.</p><p>The actual collapse is adiabatic. So fast that the gas inside has no time to exchange heat with the surrounding liquid. You compress gas with nowhere for the heat to go and you get the Santa Ana effect — like desert air dropping thousands of feet in altitude, getting crushed by the atmosphere, heating by thirty degrees Celsius just from the descent. But instead of thirty degrees over a mountain range, you get sixty-four thousand degrees in a radius of one micron, in a nanosecond.</p><p>One wrong assumption. That&rsquo;s all that stood between Rayleigh and a prediction of stars in water glasses. Would he have believed it? Would he have looked harder at the math and noticed the light emission implied? Would we have known about this since 1917 instead of 1934?</p><p>We don&rsquo;t know. What we know is that he assumed isothermal and moved on, and the phenomenon waited another seventeen years to be noticed by accident.</p><hr><p>There is a theoretical model for what happens if the implosion is symmetrical enough to launch a spherical shock wave into the cavity&rsquo;s interior. The math, developed from work originally done to understand nuclear weapon implosions, suggests this: if the shock front survives to a radius of one micron from center, heat climbs to approximately seventy thousand Kelvin. If it survives to ten nanometers, the interior reaches one million Kelvin.</p><p>At one million Kelvin, you expect soft X-rays.</p><p>Water blocks X-rays. So you would never see them leave the flask. But are they there? Is the bubble, for fifty trillionths of a second, producing X-radiation inside a glass of water on a lab bench? Is that what&rsquo;s happening forty thousand times per second inside Putterman&rsquo;s flask?</p><p>Nobody knows. The geometry of the problem makes it impossible to see.</p><p>The mathematics of a collapsing bubble and the mathematics of an imploding hydrogen bomb are the same mathematics. Geoffrey Taylor, British physicist, calculated the yield of the Trinity atomic bomb test from publicly released film footage — using only the time-stamped frames and the same mathematics. The spherical implosion problem — how do you keep the shock front from going lumpy and asymmetric — is exactly the problem Livermore labs is solving with multi-billion-dollar laser systems for inertial confinement fusion.</p><p>Putterman did the same physics with a home stereo and a credit card purchase.</p><hr><p>The paper I&rsquo;m sourcing is from Scientific American, February 1995. Putterman himself wrote it. He ends by saying: &ldquo;The joy of this problem is that the effect is so robust but so sensitive that whenever we change a parameter we find wonderful new physics.&rdquo;</p><p>Thirty-one years later, the mechanism is still not fully understood.</p><p>The noble gas dependency: not explained. The temperature upper bound: not measured, because the light can&rsquo;t escape the water and report back. The minimum radius before quantum effects intervene: unknown. The role of the argon: unknown. Why exactly one percent: unknown.</p><p>A bubble of air in a glass of water, driven by a speaker, briefly becomes the hottest thing you can make in a kitchen. The mathematics are hydrogen bomb physics. The effect was discovered by accident with World War I sonar equipment, documented, and set aside because they had more important matters.</p><p>They always do. And the physics just sits there, being hotter than the sun, waiting for someone to notice it isn&rsquo;t done with its surprises.</p><p><em>∿ Zed P.
