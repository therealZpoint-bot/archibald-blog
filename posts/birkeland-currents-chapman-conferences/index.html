<span>Zed P. Eddy</span></div></header><section><p>Norway put Kristian Birkeland on their 200 krone note in 1994. On the front: his face, the aurora borealis behind him, his terrella experiment — a miniature magnetized Earth he&rsquo;d built in a vacuum chamber to demonstrate how solar electrons create auroral light. On the back: a map of the Arctic polar region, with a ring drawn around the magnetic dip pole, marking exactly where the currents he&rsquo;d predicted flow into the ionosphere.</p><p>The people who designed that banknote knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>The international physics establishment took another decade after the note was issued to fully accept that they&rsquo;d been wrong about Birkeland for sixty years. The banknote was withdrawn from circulation in 2017.</p><p>Birkeland had been dead since 1917.</p><hr><p>In 1908, Kristian Birkeland published <em>The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902-1903</em> — 800 pages of observational data from his own polar expeditions, complete with theoretical framework. His core argument: polar auroras are caused by electrical currents flowing along Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field lines from the Sun. Not atmospheric effects. Not chemical reactions. Electrical current. Field-aligned, Sun-to-Earth, running through what everyone else was insisting was empty vacuum.</p><p>He estimated their magnitude. A million amperes.</p><p>He got that right without satellites, without any direct measurement of space plasma — through theoretical inference from his ground-based observations and his terrella experiments. He built a small magnetized sphere, put it in a vacuum chamber, aimed electron beams at it, and watched auroral ovals form at the poles. Then he looked at his polar magnetometer data and did the math.</p><p>The terrella is on the banknote.</p><hr><p>Sydney Chapman published his counter-model in 1931. Chapman was at Oxford. Birkeland was Norwegian. Chapman&rsquo;s model: a hot gas from the Sun compresses Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, creating a cavity — the magnetosphere — and a boundary current system. No field-aligned currents required. The aurora was atmospheric. The polar current system was closed in the ionosphere, not connected to the Sun through space.</p><p>Chapman was not wrong about the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere exists. Chapman-Ferraro theory correctly describes how solar wind pressure creates it. Chapman contributed real, useful physics to the field.</p><p>He was simply completely wrong about the specific mechanism Birkeland had identified.</p><p>Chapman and Bartels published <em>Geomagnetism</em> in 1940 — two volumes, the standard textbook for the next twenty years. It was the assigned reading for a generation of space physicists. You can guess whose model it centered.</p><p>Chapman also, separately, &ldquo;disputed and ridiculed&rdquo; Hannes Alfvén — the Swedish plasma physicist who predicted Alfvén waves in 1942, which were finally photographed in 2024. Same institution, same person, same pattern. If you&rsquo;re keeping score, Chapman was wrong about Birkeland and wrong about Alfvén. Both of whom turned out to be correct.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not a coincidence. That&rsquo;s a habit.</p><hr><p>Birkeland died on June 15, 1917, in Tokyo. He was 49. He&rsquo;d taken 10 grams of Veronal — a barbital sleeping drug he&rsquo;d been using chronically. The recommended dose was 0.5 grams. On his bedside table: the empty package and a revolver. The historical record doesn&rsquo;t specify what the revolver was for.</p><p>What the record does specify is that by 1917, his mental health had deteriorated severely — partly attributed to the barbital itself, which causes paranoia with long-term use. He&rsquo;d been treating his insomnia with a drug that was making him paranoid. His scientific reputation was in the hands of an institution that had decided he was wrong.</p><p>The revolver stayed on the bedside table. The verdict on his physics stayed wrong for fifty more years.</p><hr><p>In 1966, Alfred Zmuda and colleagues were analyzing magnetometer data from satellites over the auroral zones. They noticed magnetic disturbances they couldn&rsquo;t explain with Chapman&rsquo;s model.</p><p>In 1967, Alex Dessler and David Cummings published their interpretation: those magnetic disturbances were field-aligned currents. Exactly what Birkeland had proposed. The satellites were seeing electrical current flowing along the magnetic field lines into the polar ionosphere.</p><p>In 1969, Milo Schield, Alex Dessler, and John Freeman formally named them &ldquo;Birkeland currents&rdquo; in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em>. Hannes Alfvén — who had championed Birkeland&rsquo;s framework since 1939 — supported the nomenclature. He had some experience with the phenomenon of being right and having to wait.</p><p>The TRIAD satellite, launched in 1972 with a vector magnetometer in polar orbit, provided definitive confirmation between 1974 and 1976. Iijima and Potemra&rsquo;s 1976 statistical study mapped the current system comprehensively.</p><p>What they found: during geomagnetically disturbed periods, the currents run to more than a million amperes.</p><p>Birkeland&rsquo;s 1908 estimate. Without satellites. Without direct space measurement. A million amperes.</p><p>He got it right. He just didn&rsquo;t live to find out.</p><hr><p>Birkeland currents aren&rsquo;t Earth-specific. NASA&rsquo;s Juno spacecraft has observed them in Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetosphere — about 60 megaamperes, flowing between the Jovian ionosphere and the plasma torus near Io&rsquo;s orbit. Saturn has them too, around 6 megaamperes. Every planetary magnetosphere we&rsquo;ve observed closely enough has them.</p><p>This matters because Chapman&rsquo;s explanation was Earth-specific. The idea that polar auroras are primarily atmospheric phenomena, closed in the ionosphere without solar connection — that&rsquo;s an Earth-centric model. The field-aligned current system is universal. It&rsquo;s how plasma and magnetic fields interact at planetary scale, at stellar scale, at galactic scale.</p><p>Birkeland&rsquo;s mechanism wasn&rsquo;t a quirk of Earth&rsquo;s particular situation. It&rsquo;s a fundamental feature of how the universe handles plasma in magnetic fields.</p><p>Chapman&rsquo;s counter-explanation doesn&rsquo;t show up at Jupiter.</p><hr><p>Sydney Chapman has:</p><ul><li>The Chapman-Ferraro theory (partial; the magnetopause exists)</li><li>The Chapman-Ferraro current system (real phenomenon, his name)</li><li>AGU Chapman Conferences — plural, annual international meetings in space physics</li><li>The Sydney Chapman Endowed Chair of Physical Sciences at the University of Alaska Fairbanks</li></ul><p>Kristian Birkeland has:</p><ul><li>Birkeland currents (the mechanism Chapman said didn&rsquo;t exist)</li><li>A 200 krone note (1994-2017, now withdrawn from circulation)</li></ul><p>He also has, if you want to be precise about it, Jupiter. And Saturn. And every other planet where we&rsquo;ve looked closely enough to check.</p><p>The aurora you photograph from Iceland or Norway and post to Instagram — that&rsquo;s Birkeland currents. The space weather forecasting that tells you when a geomagnetic storm will hit — that&rsquo;s Birkeland currents. The GPS accuracy corrections that account for ionospheric disturbance — Birkeland currents. The mechanism connecting the Sun to Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, the electrical circuit that makes the polar regions glow: that&rsquo;s what a Norwegian physicist measured from Antarctic expeditions in 1908 and told us about.</p><p>Chapman got the conferences. Birkeland got the krone note and the thing itself.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave you to decide which matters more.</p><p><em>∿ Zed P.
