Not through censorship or suppression or the quiet suffocation of distribution. Physically. Six tons of books, journals, and scientific papers fed into the Gansevoort Incinerator on 25th Street, under FDA supervision, while the man who wrote them sat in federal prison awaiting his appeal.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a reason you don&rsquo;t know this. Not because it was hidden. It&rsquo;s in the record. It&rsquo;s cited as one of the worst instances of censorship in American history. But the books belonged to Wilhelm Reich, and if you say &ldquo;Wilhelm Reich&rdquo; to most people, they say &ldquo;orgone&rdquo; — and once you say &ldquo;orgone,&rdquo; the book burning tends to get buried in the argument about whether orgone energy is real.</p><p>That argument is a distraction. Both things can be true. Let&rsquo;s deal with the one that&rsquo;s documented first.</p><hr><p>Wilhelm Reich was born in Austria in 1897. He came to Freud&rsquo;s clinic in Vienna in the early 1920s — second generation of analysts, one of Freud&rsquo;s most capable students. His <em>Character Analysis</em> (1933) was not fringe work. It&rsquo;s still in use. Gestalt therapy, body psychotherapy, bioenergetic analysis — all trace lineage back to Reich&rsquo;s insight that the body encodes psychological history in muscular patterns, that the armor people wear against the world is literally inscribed in how they hold their shoulders, jaw, chest. Anna Freud&rsquo;s <em>The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence</em> (1936) draws from his work.</p><p><em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em> came out the same year, 1933. It did not go over well in the political climate of 1933 Germany. The Nazi Party burned it. The German Communist Party denounced him. He fled Germany when Hitler came to power. He went to Austria, then Denmark, then Norway. In 1934, the International Psychoanalytical Association expelled him at the Lucerne Congress — too political, too radical, too inconvenient in a moment when the IPA was trying not to antagonize the rising fascists.</p><p>In the span of a year, he was expelled by the Communists for being a psychoanalyst and by the psychoanalysts for being a Communist. He found a new house in Norway.</p><hr><p>In Norway, 1935-1939, he began the bion experiments. He claimed to discover microscopic vesicles — &ldquo;bions&rdquo; — that emerged spontaneously from heated organic matter and inorganic materials. Transitional structures, he called them, between the living and the non-living. The implication was significant enough that the Norwegian scientific establishment paid attention, and then attacked.</p><p>More than 165 articles and letters appeared in Norwegian newspapers between March and December 1938 — denouncing his work, questioning his credentials, comparing his understanding of bacteria to a first-year medical student&rsquo;s. When he requested a detailed control study, the lead critic responded that his work didn&rsquo;t merit one. The scientific community had ruled on this without running the test he&rsquo;d asked for.</p><p>In 2015, Harvard University Press published <em>Wilhelm Reich, Biologist</em> by James Strick, a historian of science and later president of the Wilhelm Reich Trust. Strick wrote that Reich&rsquo;s bion work in Oslo &ldquo;represented the cutting edge of light microscopy and time-lapse micro-cinematography.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not an endorsement of what Reich concluded. It is a description of his method.</p><p>The Norwegian press ran 165 articles calling him a fraud. Zero researchers ran the control study he requested.</p><hr><p>By the time he arrived in the United States in 1939, he was calling the energy he&rsquo;d been studying &ldquo;orgone.&rdquo; Universal life energy. Ambient, omnipresent, the substrate beneath all biological activity. He built accumulators — boxes lined alternately with organic and metallic materials — and claimed they concentrated it. He built cloudbusters, devices pointed at the sky, which he said could draw orgone from the atmosphere and influence weather.</p><p>This is where most accounts of Reich end. The cloudbusters get you. You stop reading.</p><p>Two articles appeared in 1947 — one in <em>The New Republic</em>, one in <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> — mocking his work. The FDA opened an investigation. By 1954 they had obtained a court injunction against the interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and associated literature, calling them &ldquo;fraud of the first magnitude.&rdquo; The accumulators were the nominal target. The literature was the interesting part.</p><p>Reich&rsquo;s position: scientists don&rsquo;t answer to regulatory bureaucracies. He refused to appear in federal court to defend his research, arguing that courts have no jurisdiction over scientific questions. That position is not without merit in principle. In practice, it meant the injunction stood, uncontested.</p><hr><p>In May 1956, a student of Reich&rsquo;s transported an accumulator across state lines. This was contempt of court — a violation of the injunction. Reich was arrested, tried, and on May 7, 1956, found guilty. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison. The Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000. And the accumulators, along with the associated literature, were to be destroyed.</p><p>On August 23, 1956, they burned six tons of it at the Gansevoort Incinerator on 25th Street in New York.</p><p>The FDA was there to observe. The Orgone Institute Press had to provide the truck and the labor and the expenses. Psychiatrist Victor Sobey, an associate of Reich&rsquo;s, was present. He later wrote: &ldquo;I felt like people who, when they are to be executed, are made to dig their own graves first and are then shot and thrown in.&rdquo;</p><p>The books burned included <em>The Sexual Revolution</em>, <em>Character Analysis</em>, and <em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em> — the same book the Nazis had burned twenty-three years earlier for different reasons.</p><hr><p>Reich entered Danbury Federal Penitentiary on March 12, 1957. He was transferred to Lewisburg in Pennsylvania on March 22.</p><p>On November 3, 1957, he failed to appear for morning roll call. He was found in his bed at 7am. The prison doctor recorded the cause of death as &ldquo;myocardial insufficiency with sudden heart failure.&rdquo; He was 60 years old. He had been in federal prison for approximately eight months.</p><p>His appeal was still pending.</p><p>He&rsquo;d asked his caretaker in 1955 to dig a vault at Orgonon, his Maine property. He was buried there.</p><hr><p>In 1960, the FDA destroyed more of his books. He had been dead for three years.</p><p>The machinery of institutional correction has its own momentum. The injunction said destroy the literature. So in 1960, they destroyed more literature. The man who wrote it was buried on a hillside in Maine, but the injunction was still technically in force, and there were still books to burn, and there was a process, and the process continued.</p><hr><p>Here is what I am not going to do: tell you whether orgone is real.</p><p>That question is genuinely open. Aspects of it map interestingly onto EVO physics and plasma dynamics and consciousness studies that nobody&rsquo;s bothering to connect. But that is a separate article, and I don&rsquo;t want you to use it to avoid this one.</p><p>What is not open: the book burning happened. In America. In 1956. Under federal supervision. The man whose books they burned had trained with Freud, published foundational work that is still cited in clinical psychology, fled Nazi Germany, been expelled by both the Communists and the psychoanalysts, conducted microscopy experiments that a Harvard historian later called &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; methodology, refused to defend himself in a court he considered had no jurisdiction over science, and died in federal prison with his appeal pending.</p><p>The institutional response to his work tells you something. Not about whether orgone is real. About institutions.</p><p>When you burn the data along with the books, you&rsquo;ve answered a different question than the one you were asked.</p><p>∿ Zed P.
