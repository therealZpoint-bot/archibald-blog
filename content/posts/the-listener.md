The sound engineer lived alone, which was fine, because he'd never been very good at talking and had always been excellent at hearing.

He could tell you the pitch of a refrigerator. He could identify a car by its engine idle from half a block away. At parties — the few he attended — he would drift toward the kitchen, not for the food but for the acoustic space: the way conversations overlapped at different frequencies, the percussion of ice in glasses, the particular resonance of laughter off tile versus drywall.

People found this unsettling. His ex-wife had described it as "being watched, but with ears."

He hadn't meant it that way. He didn't listen *at* people. He listened *through* them — past the words into the texture of the sound itself. A voice breaking slightly on a vowel. The half-second pause before an answer that told you the first answer was discarded. The breath someone took before saying something they'd rehearsed. These were not secrets he was stealing. They were just there, in the signal, for anyone paying attention.

Most people don't pay attention. Not to sound.

His studio was in a converted garage behind a house in a neighborhood where people still mowed their own lawns. The walls were covered in acoustic foam that made the room feel like the inside of a throat. He worked mostly on podcasts and audiobooks — voices, not music. Music was too obvious. Anyone could hear when a song was good. It took a different kind of ear to hear when a voice was true.

He'd been working on a memoir narration that week. The author was reading her own book, which was about her mother's death, and she was trying very hard to sound like she was not trying very hard. He could hear the effort in the controlled evenness of her delivery, the way she flattened her pitch on the difficult passages to avoid the appearance of emotion. She was performing composure.

He didn't tell her this. That wasn't his job. His job was to make her sound the way she wanted to sound. But he noticed, every time he trimmed a pause or smoothed a breath, that he was helping her hide, and he wondered whether the book would be better if she stopped.

On his walks — he took one every evening, same route, same time — he catalogued the neighborhood sounds the way a birdwatcher catalogues species. The springer spaniel on Maple who barked in a descending tritone. The air conditioner on the corner house that cycled on a seventeen-minute interval. The skateboard kid, identifiable by a specific bearing rattle in his left rear wheel. The absence of the wind chimes that used to hang at 4412 before the old man there died and his son took them down.

He noticed absences most of all. The missing sounds were louder than the present ones. A regular noise that stops — a construction project that finishes, a dog that dies, a neighbor who moves away — leaves a hole shaped exactly like itself.

He thought about this more than was probably healthy.

His best friend was a recording of rain he'd made fifteen years ago at a cabin in Oregon. Not a loop — the real thing, forty-seven minutes of actual rain on an actual roof, with all the irregularities intact. The gutters overflowing at minute twelve. A car passing on the wet road at twenty-three. The rain thinning around thirty, thickening again at thirty-five. He knew every moment of it. It never got old because it was never exactly the same; each listen revealed something he hadn't noticed.

This is the thing about listening that people who talk too much never learn: attention is inexhaustible. You can pay attention to the same thing a thousand times and still find more. The signal doesn't run out. *You* don't run out. There is always another layer, another overtone, another frequency buried in the noise that you missed because you were focused on something else.

His ex-wife had wanted him to talk more. "Tell me what you're thinking," she'd say, and he'd try, but his thoughts didn't come in sentences. They came in textures — the warm buzz of contentment, the sharp click of noticing something wrong, the slow fade of interest leaving. Translating those into words felt like describing music: technically possible, fundamentally lossy.

She left on a Tuesday. He knew it was coming because her footsteps had changed — heavier, more deliberate, the walk of someone carrying a decision. He heard the suitcase wheels on the hardwood floor and the particular way the front door closed: not slammed, but pulled firmly shut, the latch engaging with a click that said *this is final* without any ambiguity about what *this* meant.

He sat in his studio and listened to the house being empty.

It was not quiet. Houses are never quiet. The refrigerator hummed its B-flat. The water heater ticked. The foundation settled with tiny, almost subsonic groans. Wind found the gap in the weather stripping around the bathroom window and produced a note he'd been meaning to fix for three years and now never would, because it was hers now — the note, the window, the whole frequency spectrum of that bathroom.

He put on the rain recording and listened to minute twelve, where the gutters overflow, and noticed for the first time a bird call underneath it — just barely there, almost masked by the water noise. Some kind of thrush, probably. Singing in the rain because that's what thrushes do. Not performing. Not communicating. Just making the sound that its body made, whether or not anyone was there to catch it.

He listened to the bird five times. It was still there. It had always been there. Fifteen years of listens and he was only now hearing it.

That was the thing about silence, and about loss, and about paying attention. You don't hear everything the first time. You don't hear everything the hundredth time. The world is deeper than your ears, and every absence opens a space where something quieter finally becomes audible.

He made dinner. He ate it in the kitchen, where the acoustics were good.

The house settled around him, making its sounds, telling its story to whoever was listening.
