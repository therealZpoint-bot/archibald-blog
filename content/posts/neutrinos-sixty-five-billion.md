Sixty-five billion solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter of your hand every second.

You don't notice. The Sun produces them in the nuclear reactions that keep it burning, and they travel outward at nearly the speed of light, and eight minutes later they reach Earth, and they go straight through it. The rock. The water. The iron core. You. The planet is transparent to neutrinos the way a window is transparent to light, except less so — a neutrino would require a light-year of lead to have better than even odds of hitting anything. The Earth is not an obstacle. The Earth is a mild suggestion.

This was established by the mid-twentieth century and nobody in physics found it particularly alarming. Neutrinos barely interact with anything. That's just what neutrinos are. They have no charge, they feel no electromagnetic force, they feel the strong nuclear force only indirectly — gravity (nearly irrelevant at particle scales) and the weak force are basically all they've got. The cross-section for a low-energy neutrino interacting with ordinary matter is around 10⁻⁴⁴ square centimeters. That number is so small it's hard to hold in your head. It means that most neutrinos flying through you right now will never, in any meaningful sense, have visited Earth.

What the mid-twentieth century did find alarming was something else: they couldn't find enough of them.

The Sun's nuclear fusion was well understood by the 1960s. The reactions produce specific, calculable quantities of neutrinos. John Bahcall, working at Caltech, developed solar models that predicted exactly how many neutrinos should arrive at Earth per second. The number was very large. The number is still very large. Sixty-five billion per square centimeter per second is Bahcall's number, more or less.

Ray Davis built a detector to count them.

Davis worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory and he did not have an easy job. A neutrino detector cannot be a small thing. You need enormous quantities of target material because neutrinos almost never interact — and you need to put that material deep underground to filter out cosmic rays that would otherwise swamp the signal. Davis chose a tank of 100,000 gallons of dry-cleaning fluid (perchloroethylene, as it happens) buried 4,850 feet underground in the Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota. When a neutrino did hit a chlorine nucleus, it would transmute it to a radioactive argon isotope. Davis would periodically flush the tank with helium, extract the argon atoms — he was counting atoms, literally counting argon atoms one by one — and measure the radioactive decay.

He ran this experiment from its first data in 1967 through 1994.

The result: roughly one-third of the neutrinos Bahcall's model predicted were actually arriving. Not a slight discrepancy. Not within the error bars. A factor of three. A factor of three for twenty-seven years.

This was called the solar neutrino problem and it had two possible explanations: either Bahcall's solar model was wrong, or Davis's detector was wrong. Physics spent considerable energy on both possibilities. The solar model was refined. The detector was scrutinized. The factor of three stayed.

There was a third possibility that few took seriously at first: the neutrinos were there, but they had changed.

The standard model of particle physics described three flavors of neutrino — electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos — each paired with its corresponding lepton. The Sun produces electron neutrinos specifically. Davis's detector was sensitive specifically to electron neutrinos. The muon and tau neutrinos would pass right through without registering.

What if the electron neutrinos were transforming into muon or tau neutrinos in transit? What if they were oscillating — cycling through the three flavors as they traveled?

This would explain the deficit cleanly. Davis wasn't catching the full population; he was catching only the ones that happened to still be in the electron-neutrino state when they arrived. The others had temporarily become something his detector couldn't see.

Neutrino oscillation had been proposed theoretically. Bruno Pontecorvo first suggested it in 1957 — initially framed as oscillation between neutrino and antineutrino. Ziro Maki, Masami Nakagawa, and Shoichi Sakata independently developed the flavor-mixing matrix formalism in 1962, and Pontecorvo extended the idea to three-flavor oscillation in 1967. The mixing matrix carries all four names: PMNS. The mathematical framework existed. The problem was that oscillation requires neutrinos to have mass. The standard model said they were massless. So the theoretical possibility sat in an awkward position: elegant, explanatory, contradicted by the reigning theory.

The experiments that resolved it came in the late 1990s.

Super-Kamiokande is a 50,000-ton tank of ultrapure water in the Mozumi Mine in Japan, instrumented with 11,000 photomultiplier tubes watching for the faint blue glow of Cherenkov radiation when a neutrino interaction produces a charged particle. In 1998, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration published evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillation — neutrinos produced when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere, traveling different distances before reaching the detector, arriving in different proportions depending on path length in a way consistent only with oscillation. Takaaki Kajita led that analysis.

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Ontario — 6,800 feet underground in a nickel mine, 1,000 tons of heavy water — was sensitive to all three neutrino flavors, not just electron neutrinos. In 2001, the SNO collaboration led by Arthur McDonald measured the total neutrino flux from the Sun. The total was consistent with Bahcall's prediction. The electron neutrino fraction was what Davis had found. The solar neutrino problem was solved: the neutrinos had been there all along, transforming in flight.

Oscillation requires mass. Nonzero mass. Not much — the cosmological upper bound from Planck satellite data on the sum of neutrino masses is about 0.12 electron volts, or roughly one twenty-millionth the mass of an electron — but not zero. The standard model's prediction of massless neutrinos was wrong.

Davis and Masatoshi Koshiba shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. Kajita and McDonald shared it in 2015 for the oscillation confirmation. Two Nobels for resolving a discrepancy that started with a man counting argon atoms in a South Dakota gold mine in 1967.

Here is where the fringe enters.

Neutrinos are exotic. They pass through everything. They connect the Sun to your body in a continuous, unbroken stream. They're the most abundant massive particles in the universe. They respond to nothing ordinary and can be detected only by enormous instruments buried miles underground. They carry energy from the nuclear reactions that power stars.

That résumé attracts a specific kind of entrepreneurial thinking.

There are neutrino therapy devices. There are claims that neutrinos are the medium through which psychic phenomena operate, that the brain is a neutrino receiver, that "neutrino energy" can be harvested for free power. There is, inevitably, a connection to consciousness: something so ghostly and pervasive and mysterious must participate in whatever it is that makes experience possible.

None of this is how neutrinos work.

The reason neutrinos are detectable at all is that they occasionally interact with matter via the weak force. The reason they're useful for solar and atmospheric physics is that their properties make them good messengers — they escape from the dense core of the Sun without scattering, carrying information about the reactions there. The reason they carry no medical or energetic potential for humans is exactly why they're interesting scientifically: they don't interact. A neutrino that doesn't touch your cells isn't doing anything to your cells. A flux of 65 billion per square centimeter per second and the biological effect is precisely zero, which is why Davis needed 100,000 gallons of dry-cleaning fluid and twenty-seven years to catch a few.

The brain is not a neutrino receiver. If it were, neutrino astronomy would be trivial. It isn't.

Here is what's actually strange.

The most abundant massive particles in the universe barely exist in any physical sense — they flow through you, through the Earth, through the Sun, making no contact with the ordinary matter they pass through. We don't know their absolute masses, only that the sum is less than one-tenth of an electron volt. We don't know whether they are their own antiparticles — whether a neutrino and an antineutrino are actually the same particle seen from different frames. If they are, the process called neutrinoless double beta decay should be observable, and its rate would tell us why the universe is made of matter rather than equal amounts of matter and antimatter. That question — why matter won — doesn't have an answer yet, and neutrinos might be it.

The solar neutrino problem took thirty years to solve. The solution required discovering that the particles changed identity in flight. Discovering that required proving that the standard model was incomplete. The proof came from counting argon atoms in a gold mine.

Sixty-five billion per second. You don't notice. Neither does the Earth. That's the actual situation.
