She translated between languages she loved, and the thing she loved about them was the gap.

Not the words themselves — anyone with a dictionary could match words. The gap was what lived between the source and the target, the space where one language had a concept that the other could only gesture toward. The Russian word *toska* — not quite anguish, not quite longing, something that contains both and sits heavier than either. The Japanese *komorebi* — sunlight through leaves, for which English has no single word and needs an entire clause to approximate. The Portuguese *saudade*, which every translator before her had failed to capture and which she would also fail to capture, and which she loved precisely for that reason.

Her husband spoke three languages badly and one language well, and in that one language — a working-class Spanish from a town near Cadiz — he could say exactly what he meant with a precision she envied. She spoke six languages fluently and could never say exactly what she meant in any of them.

This was the fundamental problem of their marriage, and also the fundamental engine of it.

They'd met at a conference in Lyon. She was translating a panel on Mediterranean poetry; he was there because someone had told him there would be free wine. There was. He drank two glasses and then asked her, in his Cadiz Spanish, why she kept pausing before she spoke.

"I'm choosing," she said.

"Between what?"

"Between what you said and what you meant."

He laughed. Nobody had ever described his speech as containing hidden layers. He was a carpenter. He said "hand me the drill" and meant "hand me the drill." But she heard something in the way he said it — not in the words but in the rhythm, the falling cadence that people from Cadiz use, which makes even a request sound like a memory of a request, like something that has already happened and is being fondly recalled.

She told him this. He said she was overthinking it. He was probably right. She married him anyway.

They built a life in a city where neither of their native languages was spoken, which meant they lived in translation all the time. Groceries in French. Arguments in Spanish. Tenderness in a private pidgin that had no grammar and no dictionary and that neither of them could have explained to a third person. She would say a word in Russian — just the word, no context — and he would answer with a gesture, and they would both know what had been communicated, and it was something that existed in neither language but only in the space between them.

This is what she tried to explain to her students, the ones studying translation at the university, the ones who thought the job was about accuracy.

"Accuracy is a trap," she told them. "A perfectly accurate translation is a dead one. It preserves the words and loses the weather."

They wrote this down. They did not understand it. Some of them would, eventually, the ones who stayed in the field long enough to translate something that mattered to them, something where the distance between the source and the target felt personal.

Her best work was a collection of Turkish short stories by an author nobody in France had heard of. The stories were about a fishing village on the Black Sea where the economy had collapsed and the young people had left and the old people remained, mending nets for boats that no longer sailed. She spent two years on fourteen stories. The author wrote in sentences that moved like water — unhurried, reflective, carrying sediment from earlier in the paragraph. French wanted to rush. She had to slow it down, let the sentences pool and settle, trust that the reader would wait.

The reviews were kind. One critic said she had "made the Turkish visible without making it foreign." She kept that sentence in a notebook, not because it was flattering but because it described exactly what she'd tried to do, and she wanted proof that it was possible.

Her husband read the translation. He didn't read Turkish, so he couldn't compare. But he said the stories made him think of his town, which was not Turkish and not on the Black Sea and was not a fishing village, but which had also emptied out, and in which old people also maintained things whose purpose had passed.

"That's translation," she said.

"What is?"

"What just happened. You read about a place you've never been and recognized it."

He shrugged. "That's just reading."

She wanted to argue but couldn't, because he was right, and because the distinction she was making — between reading and translating, between receiving a text and crossing into it — was itself the kind of gap she spent her life navigating and could never quite close.

They grew older. His Spanish got softer, the consonants rounding out the way clay smooths under handling. Her languages multiplied — she added Mandarin at fifty, not for work but because she wanted to understand a different way of marking time, a language where tense is implied by context rather than conjugated into the verb. She found this liberating. Things didn't *happen* in Mandarin; they *existed*, and you determined when from everything around them.

She wondered if that was closer to how experience actually worked — not a timeline but a field, everything present at once, the past and future readable only from where you stood in the middle of it.

Her husband said she was overthinking it again. She probably was. But the thought stayed with her.

The evening ritual never changed. Dinner, then the balcony, then an hour of what they called "sitting" but which was actually a complex act of shared attention — each of them aware of the other, aware of the city sounds four floors below, aware of the quality of the silence between them. He would sometimes hum. She would sometimes read. Neither required the other's participation, but both were changed by the other's presence. Her reading was different when he was humming. His humming was different when she was there to hear it.

She thought about this more carefully than the situation probably warranted. But then again, that was her whole vocation — thinking carefully about the space between things. Between languages, between people, between what is said and what is meant.

The space was where the meaning lived. Not in either thing alone.

Her students wanted rules. Her editor wanted deadlines. Her husband wanted dinner. She gave them all what they asked for, and she kept for herself the thing she couldn't give: the knowledge that every translation is an act of love, because it requires you to hold two things at once and care about both of them, and to accept that the distance between them will never fully close, and to keep working in that distance anyway.

Not because you'll succeed. Because the trying is the point.

Because attention — real attention, the kind that narrates and listens and crosses and dwells — is not a means to understanding. It *is* understanding. The only kind there is.
