description: "Randell Mills has a Harvard MD, $132 million in funding, and experimental data that credentialed scientists can't explain. He also has eight employees and thirty-four years of broken commercialization promises. Both of these things are true."

In February 2021, Randell Mills demonstrated a plasma device in Washington DC that he claimed was generating 100,000 watts of continuous steam power. He called a press release. He showed the device. He made the claim.

Then the physics community continued not caring.

This is, roughly, the shape of the Randell Mills story for the last thirty-four years. Something happens. A number gets announced. Credentialed observers note something unusual. Then: silence, sarcasm, the occasional Nobel laureate dropping the word "fraud," and everything continuing exactly as before.

There's an argument this is appropriate and correct. I'll get to that. But there's also an argument that the mechanism of dismissal tells us something about how physics handles anomalous data when the theoretical violation is large enough. That argument is more interesting.

Mills holds a BA in chemistry from Franklin & Marshall (1982), an MD from Harvard Medical School (1986), and completed graduate work in electrical engineering at MIT. This biographical paragraph exists because you need to know what you're dealing with before you assess the response to it. He is not a backyard inventor. His first paper — a 1988 *Nature* publication on Mössbauer cancer therapy — was serious enough that Bristol-Myers Squibb looked at it.

In 1991 he founded BlackLight Power, later renamed Brilliant Light Power. The company's central claim: hydrogen can exist in states below its established quantum ground state. Mills calls these "hydrinos." When hydrogen transitions to these fractional states (n = 1/2, 1/3, down to 1/137), it releases energy — his models suggest roughly 200 times what you'd get from burning the same hydrogen conventionally.

The claim makes specific, testable predictions. When hydrinos form, they should emit extreme ultraviolet radiation below 80 nanometers. The catalysts involved should show characteristic spectroscopic signatures. The compounds produced should have specific electron paramagnetic resonance patterns. These are not vague mystical claims about vibrations. They are measurable quantities at specific values that Mills has been publishing for decades.

Philip Anderson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977. Wolfgang Ketterle won it in 2001. Their combined expertise in condensed matter physics and ultracold atoms constitutes, let's say, some legitimate standing to evaluate claims about hydrogen energy states.

Here's what they said.

Anderson: "If Mills is right, everything we know about everything would be a bunch of nonsense. That's why I'm so sure that it's a fraud."

Ketterle: "There is no state of hydrogen lower than the ground state. This is nonsense."

What's missing from both statements? Neither of them says: "We tested the EUV spectral predictions at the predicted wavelengths and found nothing." The dismissal is theoretical. This is a coherent position — if the theory violates quantum mechanics, the experiments that claim to support it must be wrong, full stop, and testing them further is waste. That's a defensible epistemology.

It also has a documented historical failure mode.

In 2010, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ran a spectroscopy study on BlackLight Power's plasma experiments. The lead researcher was Alexander Bykanov, a credentialed astrophysicist with a PhD. The study was contracted through GEN3 Partners, a consulting firm.

Bykanov's conclusion: "BLP's spectral results were identically independently reproduced. We could find no conventional explanation for bright light emission from hydrogen in this high-energy region."

This is not vindication. It's a finding. It says: we looked where Mills said to look, we found what he said we'd find, and we don't have a standard explanation for it. That's different from "Mills is right." But it's also different from "fraud."

In 2022, Wilfred Hagen — an electrochemistry researcher at TU Delft — co-authored a paper with Mills in the *International Journal of Hydrogen Energy*. EPR study of claimed hydrino compounds. The spectral patterns matched Mills' predictions.

After thirty-four years of institutional dismissal, the most recent independent data point is a 2022 paper with a credentialed Dutch researcher who apparently found the EPR signatures where Mills said they'd be.

This is the part where I have to be honest with you.

Thirty-four years. Eight employees as of late 2024. Series C funding. IPO target: H1 2027.

In 1999, a company spokesperson said commercial products were "within a year." In 2005: "within months." In 2008, Mills projected the company would have 500 to 1,000 employees by fall 2009. In 2009: commercialization "within 12-18 months."

How many times does a commercialization deadline have to miss before you update your model? Apparently: many. It's 2026. There are eight employees. The IPO target is H1 2027. (This is optimistic the way "fusion in ten years" has been optimistic since 1970.)

I'm not going to write you a vindication piece for a man who has absorbed $75-132 million in investment capital over three decades without producing a commercial product. That's not the institutional critique genre. That's something different.

But here's what I notice: the dismissal came first and the non-testing came second.

Andreas Rathke, writing in the *New Journal of Physics* in 2005, published the most rigorous mathematical critique of Mills' framework. He found violations of Lorentz invariance, severe internal inconsistencies, no rigorous solutions that actually predict hydrino existence. That's the legitimate scientific criticism. It's published in a peer-reviewed venue, which should put to rest the idea that Mills' work is suppressed — it's simply disputed, which is what disagreements in science look like when they're handled correctly.

But mathematical critique of a theoretical framework is different from explaining why EUV emissions below 80nm appear where Mills predicted they would. Those are separate questions. Rathke's analysis doesn't make the Bykanov data disappear. You'd need a different study for that — one that either (a) independently fails to find the EUV signatures, or (b) finds an alternative explanation for them.

That study appears not to exist. In thirty-four years, nobody seems to have run it specifically to rule out the Bykanov result.

The other pieces in this series have a clean arc: scientist makes claim, institution ignores or attacks, scientist dies, data eventually confirmed, institution names the phenomenon after the man whose work it spent forty years dismissing. Alfvén. Birkeland. Reich (different kind of ignoring). Russell.

Mills doesn't fit that arc. He's sixty-something years old and still running the company. He keeps making commercialization promises that don't materialize. The anomalous data is real but ambiguous. The theoretical framework has documented mathematical problems. The company raised over $100 million and has eight employees.

This is not a tragedy of institutional blindness. This is more complicated than that.

What happens when the theoretical violation is large enough that nobody bothers to test experimentally? Apparently this: the Nobel laureates say "fraud" without running the experiment, the astrophysicists run spectroscopy and find something weird, the electrochemists run EPR and find something matching, nobody funds a comprehensive independent study, and after thirty-four years the funding dries up by default and the question closes unanswered.

That's not fraud. It's not vindication. It's a mechanism of non-inquiry that applies more often than we talk about.

The spectroscopic data deserves a cleaner answer than it's gotten. Whether that answer is "yes, these emissions indicate a real physical phenomenon" or "no, here's the conventional explanation for what Bykanov observed" — either one would be more informative than two Nobelists saying "nonsense" while the Harvard-Smithsonian finds what Mills said they'd find.

If hydrinos exist, that's the most significant energy discovery in a century, and we should know. If they don't — and they probably don't — we should also know, based on experimental ruling-out rather than theoretical confidence.

Mills' commercialization timeline suggests he's not going to deliver the evidence himself. He's had thirty-four years to show a working device, and the company has eight employees. At some point, the window closes. The data stays ambiguous. The question goes unanswered.

And then nobody will remember to ask why the EUV emissions were in the right place.
