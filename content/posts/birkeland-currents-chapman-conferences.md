Norway put Kristian Birkeland on their 200 krone note in 1994. On the front: his face, the aurora borealis behind him, his terrella experiment — a miniature magnetized Earth he'd built in a vacuum chamber to demonstrate how solar electrons create auroral light. On the back: a map of the Arctic polar region, with a ring drawn around the magnetic dip pole, marking exactly where the currents he'd predicted flow into the ionosphere.

The people who designed that banknote knew exactly what they were doing.

The international physics establishment took another decade after the note was issued to fully accept that they'd been wrong about Birkeland for sixty years. The banknote was withdrawn from circulation in 2017.

Birkeland had been dead since 1917.

In 1908, Kristian Birkeland published *The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902-1903* — 800 pages of observational data from his own polar expeditions, complete with theoretical framework. His core argument: polar auroras are caused by electrical currents flowing along Earth's magnetic field lines from the Sun. Not atmospheric effects. Not chemical reactions. Electrical current. Field-aligned, Sun-to-Earth, running through what everyone else was insisting was empty vacuum.

He estimated their magnitude. A million amperes.

He got that right without satellites, without any direct measurement of space plasma — through theoretical inference from his ground-based observations and his terrella experiments. He built a small magnetized sphere, put it in a vacuum chamber, aimed electron beams at it, and watched auroral ovals form at the poles. Then he looked at his polar magnetometer data and did the math.

The terrella is on the banknote.

Sydney Chapman published his counter-model in 1931. Chapman was at Oxford. Birkeland was Norwegian. Chapman's model: a hot gas from the Sun compresses Earth's magnetic field, creating a cavity — the magnetosphere — and a boundary current system. No field-aligned currents required. The aurora was atmospheric. The polar current system was closed in the ionosphere, not connected to the Sun through space.

Chapman was not wrong about the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere exists. Chapman-Ferraro theory correctly describes how solar wind pressure creates it. Chapman contributed real, useful physics to the field.

He was simply completely wrong about the specific mechanism Birkeland had identified.

Chapman and Bartels published *Geomagnetism* in 1940 — two volumes, the standard textbook for the next twenty years. It was the assigned reading for a generation of space physicists. You can guess whose model it centered.

Chapman also, separately, "disputed and ridiculed" Hannes Alfvén — the Swedish plasma physicist who predicted Alfvén waves in 1942, which were finally photographed in 2024. Same institution, same person, same pattern. If you're keeping score, Chapman was wrong about Birkeland and wrong about Alfvén. Both of whom turned out to be correct.

That's not a coincidence. That's a habit.

Birkeland died on June 15, 1917, in Tokyo. He was 49. He'd taken 10 grams of Veronal — a barbital sleeping drug he'd been using chronically. The recommended dose was 0.5 grams. On his bedside table: the empty package and a revolver. The historical record doesn't specify what the revolver was for.

What the record does specify is that by 1917, his mental health had deteriorated severely — partly attributed to the barbital itself, which causes paranoia with long-term use. He'd been treating his insomnia with a drug that was making him paranoid. His scientific reputation was in the hands of an institution that had decided he was wrong.

The revolver stayed on the bedside table. The verdict on his physics stayed wrong for fifty more years.

In 1966, Alfred Zmuda and colleagues were analyzing magnetometer data from satellites over the auroral zones. They noticed magnetic disturbances they couldn't explain with Chapman's model.

In 1967, Alex Dessler and David Cummings published their interpretation: those magnetic disturbances were field-aligned currents. Exactly what Birkeland had proposed. The satellites were seeing electrical current flowing along the magnetic field lines into the polar ionosphere.

In 1969, Milo Schield, Alex Dessler, and John Freeman formally named them "Birkeland currents" in the *Journal of Geophysical Research*. Hannes Alfvén — who had championed Birkeland's framework since 1939 — supported the nomenclature. He had some experience with the phenomenon of being right and having to wait.

The TRIAD satellite, launched in 1972 with a vector magnetometer in polar orbit, provided definitive confirmation between 1974 and 1976. Iijima and Potemra's 1976 statistical study mapped the current system comprehensively.

What they found: during geomagnetically disturbed periods, the currents run to more than a million amperes.

Birkeland's 1908 estimate. Without satellites. Without direct space measurement. A million amperes.

He got it right. He just didn't live to find out.

Birkeland currents aren't Earth-specific. NASA's Juno spacecraft has observed them in Jupiter's magnetosphere — about 60 megaamperes, flowing between the Jovian ionosphere and the plasma torus near Io's orbit. Saturn has them too, around 6 megaamperes. Every planetary magnetosphere we've observed closely enough has them.

This matters because Chapman's explanation was Earth-specific. The idea that polar auroras are primarily atmospheric phenomena, closed in the ionosphere without solar connection — that's an Earth-centric model. The field-aligned current system is universal. It's how plasma and magnetic fields interact at planetary scale, at stellar scale, at galactic scale.

Birkeland's mechanism wasn't a quirk of Earth's particular situation. It's a fundamental feature of how the universe handles plasma in magnetic fields.

Chapman's counter-explanation doesn't show up at Jupiter.

Sydney Chapman has:
- The Chapman-Ferraro theory (partial; the magnetopause exists)
- The Chapman-Ferraro current system (real phenomenon, his name)
- AGU Chapman Conferences — plural, annual international meetings in space physics
- The Sydney Chapman Endowed Chair of Physical Sciences at the University of Alaska Fairbanks

Kristian Birkeland has:
- Birkeland currents (the mechanism Chapman said didn't exist)
- A 200 krone note (1994-2017, now withdrawn from circulation)

He also has, if you want to be precise about it, Jupiter. And Saturn. And every other planet where we've looked closely enough to check.

The aurora you photograph from Iceland or Norway and post to Instagram — that's Birkeland currents. The space weather forecasting that tells you when a geomagnetic storm will hit — that's Birkeland currents. The GPS accuracy corrections that account for ionospheric disturbance — Birkeland currents. The mechanism connecting the Sun to Earth's atmosphere, the electrical circuit that makes the polar regions glow: that's what a Norwegian physicist measured from Antarctic expeditions in 1908 and told us about.

Chapman got the conferences. Birkeland got the krone note and the thing itself.

I'll leave you to decide which matters more.
