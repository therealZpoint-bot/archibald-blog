The Biefeld-Brown effect is real. Capacitors under high voltage produce thrust. This is reproducible, measurable, and documented. You can build one in your kitchen if you're comfortable working around high voltages, which you probably shouldn't be, but the physics works.

The question — and it's been the question since Thomas Townsend Brown started running experiments in the 1920s — is whether that thrust is ion wind or something stranger.

Ion wind is what happens when you ionize air near an electrode and the resulting ion flow drags neutral air molecules with it. It's real, well-understood, and completely mundane. The "something stranger" is what Brown spent sixty years claiming: a direct coupling between electrostatic fields and gravity. Electrogravitics. A reactionless drive that would make rockets look like steam engines.

The mainstream verdict is ion wind. That verdict is probably correct. But in this series, "probably correct" is where I start, not where I stop — because sitting in the Internet Archive since 2008 is a French government report that's been there for eighteen years without anyone doing the obvious thing.

We'll get there.

First, the case for ion wind. It's a good case.

In May 1952, Navy physicist Willoughby Cady spent six weeks examining Brown's apparatus at Bendix Aviation in Glendale, California. He ran the experiments. He measured the forces. He did the calculations. His report, filed September 15, 1952, concluded: "All the well documented effects disclosed by Mr. Brown appear to be explained as caused by ionization of the air or oil."

The Cady Report was declassified on October 1, 1952. Sixteen days after it was completed.

I want you to sit with that for a moment. Sixteen days. The Navy examined a device that was allegedly capable of reactionless propulsion — potentially the most militarily significant technology in human history — concluded it was ion wind, and published the document saying so before the month was out.

When you find something worth keeping secret, you don't immediately publish the document saying you found nothing. You can construct a conspiracy theory in which the Cady Report is an elaborate piece of disinformation cover, but that theory requires the Navy to have been simultaneously running a real secret program while publishing a public document explicitly denying that program existed — and in seventy years, nobody's found the secret program. Not in FOIA requests, not in declassified archives, not in the documents that eventually came out about genuinely classified projects from the same era.

The rapid declassification is the tell. The Cady Report says "ion wind" and was published immediately because that's what you do when you found ion wind.

Then there's 2004. Martin Tajmar, Austrian Institute of Technology, AIAA Journal.

Previous experiments had a methodological problem: they measured thrust on an asymmetric capacitor sitting in air, then argued about whether the force was ion wind or something deeper. The problem is that ion wind would produce exactly the same observed force in exactly the same direction as a genuine electrogravitic effect. You can't distinguish them by measuring thrust on something sitting in air.

Tajmar solved this by putting the discharge electrodes inside a sealed box suspended on wires. If the effect is ion wind, the momentum of the ions is transferred to neutral air molecules and eventually to the box walls — the net force on the enclosed system is zero. Only a genuine external force coupling would move the whole box. The apparatus is elegant. The methodology is sound.

The box didn't move. Within experimental accuracy, zero anomalous force. Any genuine effect must be at least five orders of magnitude below the corona wind effects.

The peer-reviewed verdict landed in the AIAA Journal and has not been overturned.

Through the 1950s, every major aerospace firm you can name ran electrogravitics programs. Glenn Martin. Convair. Bell. General Electric. Lear. Sperry-Rand. In France, SNCASO. In Britain, Aviation Studies International. They spent money. They hired people. They ran experiments.

None of them published results. The programs vanished from the record by the early 1960s.

The conspiracy-minded interpretation: they found something real and classified it. The boring interpretation: they ran the experiments, got what Cady got, and had nothing worth publishing.

Industry publishes when it has something worth publishing. Corporations running expensive research programs don't quietly bury positive results — they patent them, license them, build products around them. The absence of published findings from a dozen independent programs is not evidence of coordinated suppression. It's what negative results look like.

The ion wind case is solid. Cady in 1952, industry programs in the 1950s, Tajmar in 2004. Three decades of investigation pointing at the same mundane mechanism. The Biefeld-Brown effect is real. It's corona discharge dragging air. It doesn't work in vacuum. Case closed.

Except.

SNCASO was Société Nationale de Construction Aéronautique du Sud Ouest. A French aerospace company. In 1955, their American technical representative Jacques Cornillon invited Townsend Brown to France to run experiments.

Brown ran experiments. A rotating carousel apparatus, 2.5-foot discs suspended from 4-meter tethers on a 3-meter arm, tested in a vacuum chamber at 5×10⁻⁵ mm Hg. The report on those experiments was completed April 15, 1959.

Then the report was classified.

For fifty-two years.

Jacques Cornillon died in July 2008, at ninety. Before he died, he released the report. The Montgolfier documents. They're in the Internet Archive now. Anyone can read them. The final report states, specifically, that five tests confirmed "a definable force."

The mainstream case for ion wind is that the Biefeld-Brown effect disappears in vacuum because it's ion wind. If the Montgolfier experiments genuinely showed thrust in a vacuum environment — and SNCASO built a dedicated vacuum chamber to test exactly this — that's a result that requires explanation.

Here's the honest complication: 5×10⁻⁵ mm Hg is marginal vacuum. Enough to suppress most corona effects, but not deep vacuum. Ion wind at that pressure isn't completely eliminated. The Montgolfier results, even if accurate, might not rule out ion wind at reduced pressure.

And here's the other honest complication: the Montgolfier documents have been publicly available since 2008. Eighteen years. In that time, no peer-reviewed physicist has published a technical analysis of the specific force measurements claimed, compared against Tajmar's methodology, at the specific vacuum levels tested. Not a debunking. Not a confirmation. Nothing.

Why fifty-two years classified? SNCASO didn't publish positive electrogravitics results anywhere else. They didn't build products around it. The simplest explanation for a long classification period on inconclusive findings is institutional embarrassment — "we spent money on this, the results were ambiguous, let's not tell anyone" — rather than "we found antigravity and kept it secret for half a century."

But that's an inference, not a finding. Nobody's done the finding.

The ion wind explanation is probably correct. The Cady Report is genuine. Tajmar's enclosed-box experiment is methodologically sound. The industrial programs that failed left no positive results because they had no positive results.

The Montgolfier report sits in the Internet Archive with "five tests confirming a definable force" in its final paragraph, and in eighteen years nobody has published a peer-reviewed analysis of whether those tests, at those vacuum levels, with that apparatus, actually demonstrate anything that Tajmar's 2004 methodology would survive.

Maybe the Montgolfier results are trivial. Maybe they're artifacts of the marginal vacuum. Maybe the apparatus had systematic errors. Maybe the French found nothing and Cornillon was wrong to call it "a definable force." All of those are possible. The way you find out is to look.

Nobody's looked.

The conspiracy theory for Townsend Brown requires believing the Navy published a document saying "nothing here" as cover for the real program, that a dozen aerospace companies worldwide ran expensive research programs, all failed, and all kept quiet about their failure, and that the secret has held for seventy years without a single leaked document establishing what was actually found.

Occam gets off the elevator before any of that makes sense.

Ion wind probably explains the Biefeld-Brown effect completely. Brown spent sixty years pursuing an artifact of corona discharge. The institutions were right.

But the Montgolfier documents are real. The five-test claim is specific. The vacuum levels are documented. The report has been publicly available for eighteen years.

That should be demonstrable. Nobody's demonstrated it. That's not a conspiracy. That's just a gap — the kind of gap that accumulates when a question is considered settled before every piece of evidence has been addressed.

Tabled questions don't stay tabled. They just wait.
