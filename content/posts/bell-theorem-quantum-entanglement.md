In October 2022, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger "for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science."

Translation: three physicists spent their careers proving that the universe cannot be locally real.

If you've heard about this from a quantum healer, I need you to stop and read carefully. They got the wrong lesson.

Start with Einstein, 1935.

By then, quantum mechanics was already the most successful theory in physics. Dirac, Bohr, Heisenberg had built it. It worked everywhere anyone tested it. But Einstein had a problem with it, and he put his problem in a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that year. The EPR paper.

The problem was this: quantum mechanics says that two particles can be entangled. Measure the spin of one particle and you instantly know the spin of the other, no matter how far apart they are. Measure here, know something about there. Instantaneously.

He later called this "spooky action at a distance" (the phrase appears in a 1947 letter to Max Born, not the 1935 paper itself, but it captures the argument perfectly). Nothing travels faster than light. If measuring one particle instantly determines the state of another particle in another city, in another galaxy, then something is wrong with quantum mechanics. It must be incomplete. There must be "hidden variables" — pre-set instructions built into the particles at the moment they're created that explain the correlations without requiring any spooky action.

Think of it this way. If you put one red glove in a box and mail it to Tokyo, and you open your box in Bangkok and find a blue glove, you instantly know the Tokyo box contains a red glove. That's not spooky. That's just that the gloves were sorted before they were mailed. Hidden variable. Pre-existing state. No instantaneous influence required.

Einstein thought quantum entanglement was like the gloves. The particles look correlated because they were always going to be correlated. Quantum mechanics just doesn't know about the hidden variables yet.

He was wrong.

In 1964, a physicist from Northern Ireland named John Bell, on sabbatical from CERN at Stanford, asked a question that changed physics.

He asked: if hidden variables exist, what constraints do they put on the statistics of measurements?

He derived an inequality. A mathematical bound on how correlated the measurement results of entangled particles can be, under any local hidden variable theory: any theory where the particles carry pre-existing properties and don't influence each other faster than light.

Then he computed what quantum mechanics predicts.

Quantum mechanics violates Bell's inequality. The correlations it predicts are too strong to be explained by any local hidden variable theory. Either quantum mechanics is wrong, or Einstein's glove model is wrong. One of them had to go.

Bell had converted a philosophical argument into an empirical test. The universe could answer this question. You just had to do the experiment.

John Clauser and Stuart Freedman did the first serious experiment in 1972. Alain Aspect and his team at the Institut d'Optique in Orsay ran a series of experiments from 1980 to 1982 that are still held as the decisive early test. The results were unambiguous: Bell's inequality is violated. The universe does not behave like a glove factory.

The hidden variables don't exist. Or if they do, they're not local. The correlations cannot be explained by pre-existing properties that travel with the particles. Something genuinely strange is happening.

There were loopholes. Experimentalists spent the next three decades closing them — the detection loophole, the locality loophole, the freedom-of-choice loophole. In 2015, three simultaneous groups (in Delft, Boulder, and Vienna) ran loophole-free Bell tests. All three confirmed violation. In 2016, the "Big Bell Test" used 100,000 human volunteers worldwide — playing an online game to generate unpredictable choices — to select measurement settings, closing the freedom-of-choice loophole with human agency itself. Results published 2018.

Every test has confirmed the same thing. Bell's inequality is violated. What those violations mean, given the accumulated experimental evidence, is that the universe cannot be described by any theory that is both local and realistic.

The 2022 Nobel Prize was for proving this conclusively.

Here is what the violation does not mean.

You cannot use entanglement to send information faster than light.

This is not a technicality. It is a theorem. The no-communication theorem. The correlations between entangled particles are real (the statistics genuinely violate Bell's inequality), but you cannot control what you measure. When you measure your particle, you get a random result. Your partner measures theirs, they get a random result. When you compare notes afterward, through a classical channel that travels at the speed of light or slower, the correlations appear.

The spookiness is real. The information transfer is not. You can only see the correlation in hindsight. The universe is non-local in a mathematically precise way that cannot be exploited.

This is not a pedantic distinction. It is the entire point.

Deepak Chopra has a book called "Quantum Healing." There are approximately twelve thousand Instagram accounts that have concluded from Bell's theorem that consciousness creates reality, that we're all connected at a quantum level, that you can align your healing energy with the non-local fabric of the universe.

I have some notes.

The quantum wellness industry made two mistakes. The first mistake is ignoring the no-communication theorem. The second mistake is failing to understand what "non-local" means in this context.

"Non-local" means the statistical correlations between measurement outcomes cannot be explained by local hidden variables. It means the universe fails to satisfy a specific mathematical inequality under specific experimental conditions. It does not mean that your thoughts in Bangkok affect events in Tokyo. It does not mean that consciousness is entangled with the cosmos. It does not mean that focusing your intention on healing energy will affect your inflammatory markers.

The correlations are between particles prepared together in a lab, measured with optical equipment, compared using classical data transfer after the fact. They are not between your consciousness and the universe. They are not exploitable. They cannot heal anything.

The quantum healers didn't get this from Einstein, and they didn't get it from Bell. They got it from the word "quantum" and a feeling.

Here is what's actually strange.

Bell's theorem is a mathematical result: quantum mechanics is incompatible with any local hidden-variable theory. What the experiments add is this: quantum mechanics is right. Which means local hidden variables are ruled out. The universe, as far as we can test it, cannot be described by any theory that is both local and realistic. Local means: no faster-than-light causal influences. Realistic means: physical quantities have definite values before measurement, independent of observation.

The universe fails at least one of these. Possibly both.

Think about what that means. Either there are genuine faster-than-light correlations in nature (that cannot be used for communication, that are real anyway), or the universe doesn't have a definite state before you look at it. Or some combination of both. Physicists argue about which interpretation is right. The experiments can't distinguish between them. What the experiments can say, conclusively, is that the Einstein glove model is wrong.

The world is not made of things with properties that exist independently of how you measure them. That is not a spiritual claim. That is what the math says, and what fifty years of experiments have confirmed.

The quantum healers took "the universe is strange at the quantum level" and concluded "therefore crystals."

What Bell's theorem and the experiments together actually say is stranger than that. The universe, at its most fundamental level, cannot be described by any picture in which things have definite properties before you look at them. That is a true and strange fact about physical reality. It was proved in a laboratory with photons and detectors, confirmed across fifty years of progressively tighter experiments, and certified by the Nobel committee in 2022.

It will not improve your chakras.

Einstein lost this argument. He was right that entanglement is real. He was wrong that it means quantum mechanics is incomplete. The universe is genuinely weird in the way quantum mechanics says it is.

What he didn't anticipate was that the weirdness would be confirmed experimentally, that Bell would find a way to test it, that Aspect would test it, that the Nobel committee would certify it, and that a wellness industry would spring up to sell the weirdness back to people as confirmation of ancient wisdom about cosmic connection.

The universe is not locally real. That is one of the strangest facts in science.

It's stranger than what they're selling.
