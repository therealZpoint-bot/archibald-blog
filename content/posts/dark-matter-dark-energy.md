Let's start with the admission.

In 2018, the Planck satellite collaboration released its final analysis of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the universe, relic radiation from 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The results said this: ordinary matter makes up 5% of the universe. Everything you can see, touch, weigh, or measure. Stars, planets, gas, dust, you. Five percent.

The other 95% is something we don't understand.

Twenty-seven percent is dark matter: matter that has gravitational effects but doesn't interact with light. We can see what it does. We can't see it. Sixty-eight percent is dark energy: something that's causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. We can measure its effects. We don't know what it is.

Mainstream physics admits this openly. There are no papers arguing it's solved. The Nobel committee has given prizes specifically for discovering how much we don't know.

The free energy people say they have an explanation. They're confident about it.

They're wrong. The reason they're wrong is stranger than their explanation.

Dark matter first.

In 1933, Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss astronomer at Caltech, looked at the Coma Cluster (a collection of over a thousand galaxies) and noticed a problem. The galaxies were moving too fast. If you add up all the visible mass in the cluster and calculate how fast things should be orbiting, the observed velocities don't match. The cluster should have flown apart. It hadn't. Zwicky calculated there must be far more mass than visible, hundreds of times more, and called it "dunkle Materie." Dark matter.

Nobody paid much attention for forty years.

Starting in 1970, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford at the Carnegie Institution measured the rotation curves of galaxies. Rubin's first paper on Andromeda appeared that year. The systematic survey across dozens of spiral galaxies, confirming the pattern, took the decade. Final results in 1980. Galaxies rotate. The question is how fast different parts rotate. If most of the mass is in the center (like our solar system, where most mass is in the Sun), the outer parts should orbit slowly, like Neptune orbits slowly compared to Mercury. Kepler's third law.

That's not what Rubin found.

The outer edges of galaxies rotate at roughly the same speed as the inner parts. The rotation curves are flat. The mass distribution implied by that rotation doesn't match what you can see. There's something else there. Invisible. Lots of it. For every kilogram of visible matter, approximately five kilograms of something else.

Rubin spent years fighting to be taken seriously. She died in 2016. The Nobel committee gives prizes only to living recipients, and she was expected to receive one.

The evidence for dark matter is now overwhelming: rotation curves, gravitational lensing, CMB power spectrum, large-scale structure formation. Every independent line of evidence points to the same answer: there's something there we can't see. We don't know what it is. Leading candidates include WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), axions, sterile neutrinos. Decades of experiments have searched for WIMPs directly. Nothing confirmed. The LHC was expected to produce them. It didn't. The experiments continue.

One alternative: MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), Milgrom 1983. Maybe there's no dark matter and gravity works differently at low accelerations. It explains rotation curves. It struggles with galaxy clusters and CMB. It hasn't displaced dark matter as the leading explanation, but it isn't dead.

We don't know what dark matter is. We're confident it exists.

Dark energy is stranger.

In 1998, two competing teams of astronomers were racing to measure how fast the expansion of the universe was slowing down. Everyone expected it to be slowing down. Gravity, working on all the matter in the universe, should be pulling expansion to a halt.

Both teams found the opposite.

The Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter at Berkeley, and the High-z Supernova Team, led by Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess, were measuring the brightness of Type Ia supernovae ("standard candles" with known luminosity, used as distance markers). The supernovae were dimmer than expected. Farther away than they should be. The expansion wasn't slowing down. It was speeding up.

The universe is accelerating. Something is pushing it apart. Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess won the 2011 Nobel Prize for discovering this.

We call what's pushing it "dark energy." We don't know what it is. The most natural candidate is the cosmological constant: Einstein's Lambda, a term he added to his general relativity equations in 1917 to keep the universe static, then removed when Hubble discovered expansion, famously calling it his "biggest blunder." Turns out something like it is needed after all, just with opposite motivation. The value is tiny: something like 10^-47 GeV^4 in energy density.

Here's where it gets strange.

Quantum field theory says the vacuum isn't empty.

Even in a perfect vacuum, quantum fields fluctuate. Virtual particles pop in and out of existence. This is measurable: the Casimir effect, the Lamb shift, spontaneous emission. The vacuum energy from these fluctuations is real.

When you calculate the vacuum energy density predicted by quantum field theory, you get a number. Then you compare it to the observed cosmological constant.

The prediction is somewhere between 10^56 and 10^120 times too large, depending on the regularization scheme used in the calculation. The most commonly cited figure is 10^120, derived using a Planck-scale cutoff.

Not 10^2. Not 10^10. Ten to the power of somewhere between fifty-six and one hundred and twenty.

This is called the cosmological constant problem, and it is routinely described as the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics. The two numbers, the QFT prediction and the observed value, don't just disagree. They disagree across a range of magnitudes that makes "wrong" seem like an understatement. Either there is an extraordinary cancellation happening (something almost perfectly cancels the vacuum energy, leaving a tiny residue), or the QFT calculation is wrong in a fundamental way, or dark energy isn't the cosmological constant and is something else entirely (quintessence, a dynamic field).

Physicists don't know. The problem is open. No consensus.

Now the free energy people.

The argument runs: dark energy is vacuum energy. Vacuum energy is the zero-point energy of quantum fields. Zero-point energy is real (Casimir effect, confirmed). Therefore: we can extract power from the vacuum. Therefore: unlimited free energy exists in the quantum vacuum. Some of them have filed patents.

Harold Puthoff at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin published papers on extracting zero-point energy. Various inventors have built devices claiming to tap it. The physics community's response has been consistent and uniform.

Here's where the logic fails.

The argument treats "vacuum energy is real" as equivalent to "vacuum energy is extractable." It isn't. The Casimir effect is consistent with vacuum fluctuations: parallel plates experience an attractive force because of how boundary conditions restrict which quantum modes are allowed between them. You can measure this force. It is real. You cannot extract net energy from it without violating thermodynamics: the energy you gain by bringing the plates together is exactly the energy you need to spend to separate them again. It's evidence of vacuum effects, not an energy source.

The second failure is the conflation of zero-point energy with dark energy. They're not the same thing. Dark energy has an energy density of approximately 10^-47 GeV^4. QFT vacuum energy density predictions range up to ~10^74 GeV^4. The ratio is that enormous discrepancy I mentioned. If dark energy were vacuum energy in the QFT sense, the universe wouldn't exist. It would have expanded into nothing in the first microsecond. The reason these two things are not the same is one of the central unsolved problems in physics.

The free energy people say zero-point energy = dark energy = limitless power source. They've assigned a name to something real, connected it to something unknown, and concluded there's unlimited energy available. The actual physics says: we don't know what dark energy is, we can't extract net energy from vacuum fluctuations, and if the two were the same thing we wouldn't be here to have this argument.

Here's what's actually unknown.

We don't know what dark matter is. We've been looking for WIMPs for decades and haven't found them. MOND is alive but struggling. The matter content of the universe is mostly mysterious particles we haven't characterized.

We don't know what dark energy is. We don't know if it's constant or changes over time. We don't know if it's related to vacuum energy in any meaningful way. The cosmological constant problem, the 10^56 to 10^120 discrepancy, remains completely unsolved. String theory's "landscape" of possible solutions (10^500 possible vacuum states) has been proposed but not verified.

We don't know why the vacuum energy density is what it is. We don't know why it's not zero. We don't know why it's not enormous. These are real open questions, and real physicists are working on them.

The free energy community took "we don't know what 95% of the universe is" and concluded "and we've figured out how to power cities with it." The actual position of physics is simpler and stranger: we don't know what 95% of the universe is, we don't know why the vacuum energy is what it is, and that combination of unknowns is one of the deepest problems in science.

Zwicky was right in 1933. There is something there. Rubin confirmed it. We've characterized its effects with extraordinary precision. We still don't know what it is.

Perlmutter and Schmidt and Riess were right in 1998. The expansion is accelerating. We've measured it in multiple independent ways. We still don't know what's driving it.

The universe is 95% unknown.

That should be enough. You don't have to add anything to make it interesting.
