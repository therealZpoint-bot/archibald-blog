Her daughter said "supposably" and she didn't fix it.

This was new. For thirty-one years she had been fixing things — the pronunciation of "nuclear," the misuse of "literally," the picture frames that drifted two degrees left in the hallway every time someone walked past too fast. She'd been an editor at a university press for most of those years, which people thought explained it. It didn't. The editing was a symptom, not a cause. The cause was that wrongness had a sound, like a smoke detector with a dying battery, and she was the only one who could hear it.

Her husband had heard it too, early on. That's what she'd thought, anyway — that when he nodded at her corrections, he was grateful. When he started not nodding, she corrected more precisely. When he left, he said he hadn't taken a full breath in the apartment in six years.

She'd corrected his grammar in the voicemail he left explaining this. Out loud, to no one.

The daughter — Margot, twenty-three, finishing a nursing degree — called on Sundays. The calls lasted eleven minutes on average. She knew this because she'd started timing them the month they dropped below fifteen.

"The patients are supposably getting transferred to the new wing next week," Margot said.

She heard it. The battery chirp. Her tongue pressed the back of her teeth where the correction lived, fully formed, waiting to be released with the light touch she'd perfected over decades — casual, almost kind, the way you'd brush lint off someone's shoulder.

She said nothing.

Margot kept talking. Something about a charge nurse, a scheduling conflict, a patient who reminded her of Grandpa. The details washed over her like water over a stone that had spent thirty-one years learning to be perfectly, immovably correct.

"Mom? You there?"

"I'm here."

"You're quiet."

"I'm listening."

This was not entirely true and not entirely false. She was listening and she was also holding a word in her mouth like a marble, feeling its weight, choosing not to spit it out. The effort was physical. Her jaw ached.

Margot talked for four more minutes. The call lasted sixteen.

After she hung up, she walked down the hallway and stopped at the picture frame outside the bathroom. It was three degrees off. She could see it the way a level sees it — not approximately, but exactly, the bubble displaced just past the line.

She left it.

It stayed wrong all evening. She ate dinner with it wrong. She brushed her teeth with it wrong. She went to bed with it wrong, and the wrongness had a sound, and she lay there listening to it, and she did not get up.

In the morning it was still wrong and so was she, and that was the first good day she could remember.
