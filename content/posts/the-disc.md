The disc was the size of a dinner plate and worth more than Koczor's house.

Yttrium barium copper oxide, two layers, fabricated over eleven months by a process that nobody at Marshall could fully explain, including the Finnish physicist they'd flown in to supervise. It was gray-white and surprisingly light, and when Koczor held it — once, briefly, with nitrile gloves, his hands not quite shaking — it felt like holding a communion wafer made of math.

The disc was supposed to levitate, spin at three thousand RPM, and shield gravity by two percent. They'd spent $600,000 on the equipment to make it do this: cryostat, magnetic stator, measurement rig, vacuum housing. The equipment was in boxes in Building 4487. Some of it had been in boxes for three years.

"We should set up the rig," Chen said, every few months.

"We will," Koczor said.

They didn't.

The problem wasn't technical. The problem was that the disc was the only one. They'd tried to fabricate spares. The ceramic cracked during sintering, or the layers delaminated, or the grain structure was wrong. Eleven months of work had produced exactly one disc that might be a superconductor, and no way to know if it was a superconductor without cooling it to seventy Kelvin, and no way to know if it shielded gravity without spinning it, and no way to spin it without risking the only evidence that the question was worth asking.

Podkletnov visited twice. He was smaller than Koczor expected and had the anxious politeness of a man whose career had been decided by a newspaper article he didn't write. He examined the equipment in its boxes. He held the disc — without gloves, Koczor noticed, and with steadier hands.

"You must spin it," Podkletnov said.

"We know," Koczor said.

Podkletnov flew home. The disc went back into its nitrogen-flushed case. Chen stopped asking about the rig.

The thing Koczor understood, that he could not put in a report, was that the disc in its case was more valuable than the disc on the rig. On the rig, it would either shield gravity or it wouldn't. In the case, it could do both. It was the most expensive Schrödinger's cat in Alabama — alive and dead and federally funded, and every month it stayed in the case was another month the question remained open, and an open question at NASA was an active project, and an active project was a budget line, and a budget line was a reason to come to work in the morning.

Chen transferred to Ames in 2003. The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics program lost its funding in 2002. Koczor wrote the final report. He described the disc as "promising but untested" and the project as "too difficult without considerable effort."

The disc is still in Huntsville. The equipment is still in boxes.

Nobody calls it a failure because nobody ever ran the test.
