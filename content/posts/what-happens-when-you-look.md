Quantum mechanics is the most accurate scientific theory in human history. The Dirac equation predicts the magnetic moment of the electron to 12 decimal places. The Standard Model has been confirmed to parts per trillion. No theory has been more precisely validated by experiment.

None of this tells you what happens when you look.

The wavefunction collapse problem -- what occurs when a quantum system is measured -- has been unresolved since Heisenberg in 1927. Not unresolved as in "partially understood, more work needed." Unresolved as in: physicists actively disagree about whether anything happens at all, whether the word "happens" is even applicable, and whether asking the question constitutes legitimate physics or the kind of philosophy they agreed to stop doing.

The Copenhagen interpretation -- dominant for 60 years -- is a formal ban on the question. "Shut up and calculate" is not metaphor. It is institutional policy. Don't ask what the wavefunction is; compute what it predicts. The predictions are extraordinary. But the ban is still the default position in most physics departments. Has it resolved anything? The question has been sitting there since 1927. It's still there.

When Copenhagen became embarrassing, physics invented decoherence. Wavefunctions don't actually collapse -- they entangle with their environment, spreading quantum correlations into the surroundings until interference effects become immeasurably small. The weirdness doesn't disappear. It hides. Decoherence is technically correct and completely sidesteps the original problem. It explains why you don't see quantum superpositions at your scale. But it doesn't explain why you see *one* outcome and not another. The measurement problem is still there. Decoherence made it better dressed.

This is what institutional physics looks like when it has a problem it cannot solve but must appear to have solved.

Everett's many-worlds interpretation says every measurement outcome occurs -- reality branches into all possible histories simultaneously. Most physicists find this aesthetically unacceptable. But it predicts nothing different from Copenhagen. It is formally unfalsifiable. If a theory predicts nothing different from the theory it replaces and is additionally unfalsifiable, what exactly is it doing? It has been gaining ground in serious physics literature for 30 years.

Penrose and Wigner proposed that consciousness collapses the wavefunction -- that the act of a conscious observer brings one outcome into being. This is treated as fringe. The reason it's treated as fringe is that we don't have a scientific account of consciousness. So: two acknowledged gaps. One is legitimate physics. One is philosophy someone agreed to stop doing.

In 1964, John Bell proved that quantum mechanics requires nonlocality -- measurements on entangled particles correlate instantaneously regardless of distance, in ways no local hidden variable theory can reproduce. Alain Aspect closed the loophole in 1982 at the Institut d'Optique Théorique et Appliquée in Orsay, using analyzers that switched orientation faster than light could travel between them. The universe violated Bell's inequality by five standard deviations. Einstein spent the last two decades of his life certain this couldn't happen. The universe is not locally real. This is not interpretation. This is experimental result.

In 2019, at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Massimiliano Proietti and colleagues built an extended Wigner's Friend scenario with six entangled photons and four quantum observers. The experiment ran for 360 hours. It collected 1,794 six-photon coincidence events across 64 measurement settings. It violated the Bell-type inequality by five standard deviations. What it showed: two observers can look at the same quantum event and have irreconcilable accounts of what happened.

Not different interpretations. Not complementary perspectives. Irreconcilable.

"This calls into question the objective status of the facts established by the two observers," the paper concluded. Physics had been arguing about what happens when you look. In 2019, four observers looked. They disagree on what they saw. What did they see? That is now an open experimental question, not a philosophical one. The machine disagreed with itself. That's the record.

The standard response is instrumentalism: the wavefunction is a calculational tool, not a description of something real. Don't ask what the electron is doing between measurements -- that question is malformed. The theory tells you what you'll measure. It doesn't tell you what's there. For nearly 100 years, professional consensus has been that this is fine.

A theory that predicts observations without describing what produces them has a name in philosophy. It's called an instrument. The most accurate scientific theory in human history might be an instrument -- a description of outputs with no underlying account of mechanism. Nobody asks what the gap implies.

A watched pot never boils. In quantum mechanics, this is literally true. The quantum Zeno effect -- observing an unstable system frequently enough prevents it from decaying -- was first demonstrated in 1990 by Wayne Itano and colleagues at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, using around five thousand beryllium ions in a Penning trap. One measurement at 256 milliseconds: 100% of ions transitioned. Add an intermediate measurement at 128 milliseconds: 50% transitioned. Observation suppressed the event. Not as metaphor. Measured, recorded, repeatable.

Who, exactly, counts as an observer? A scientist with a detector? A photon interacting with another photon? A quantum system registering a correlation it will never report? The question keeps the measurement problem alive because physics has never answered it. Not for lack of trying. For lack of an answer.

We've known that observation changes outcome for 100 years. We've become very skilled at not thinking about it.

So: what happens when you look?

The universe makes a decision. Which decision it makes appears to depend on who's doing the looking -- because in Edinburgh in 2019, two observers looked and the universe gave them different answers. Physics has spent a century building progressively more sophisticated frameworks for not having to say that. The frameworks are elegant. The gap is still there.

The watched pot is watching you back. Whether you find that unsettling is, at this point, a personal problem.
