description: "The US government has confirmed UAP are real, credentialed intelligence officials testified under oath about crash retrieval programs, and the Navy filed patents on inertial mass reduction devices and spent $500,000 testing them. Mainstream physics has not engaged. That silence is a data point."

The United States government spent decades telling you there was nothing there.

Then, in June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a preliminary assessment of 144 military UAP encounters. Of those 144, exactly one was explained. The other 143 could not be identified with high confidence. Eighteen of them featured objects that "appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion."

Discernible means of propulsion. That's the phrase. That's the moment you might expect physics to notice.

Physics did not notice.

In 2022, the Pentagon stood up the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. As of their most recent reporting: 757 cases catalogued. 21 cases with sufficient data to rule out conventional explanations — 21 cases where the evidence was good enough to definitively say "this is not a weather balloon, not a drone, not a sensor artifact" — and that figure was never proactively disclosed by AARO's first director. It came out through external reporting.

In July 2023, David Grusch — former intelligence officer, NRO representative to the UAP Task Force, credentialed and cleared to know things you and I aren't — sat in front of the House Oversight Committee and testified under oath. He said he was informed, in the course of his official duties, of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program to which he was denied access. He said these were "retrieving non-human origin technical vehicles." He said there were non-human biologics recovered from crash sites.

Before you reach for your comfortable dismissal: the Intelligence Community Inspector General assessed his complaint as credible and urgent. He filed through official channels. He faced documented retaliation. That retaliation is now explicitly prohibited under the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act, because Congress took it seriously enough to change the law. He based his claims on interviews with over forty witnesses over four years, many with direct program knowledge.

You can think Grusch is wrong. That's a defensible position. What you cannot do with intellectual honesty is say this isn't worth physics' attention.

The Navy, meanwhile, had already been making its own kind of argument.

In 2015, Salvatore Cezar Pais, an aerospace engineer at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, began filing a series of patents on behalf of the United States Navy. Patent US10144532B2: "Craft using an Inertial Mass Reduction Device." The claim: generating high-frequency electromagnetic fields can reduce the inertial mass of an object, enabling extraordinary acceleration without conventional g-force coupling. Additional patents covered a compact fusion reactor, a room-temperature superconductor, and a high-frequency gravitational wave generator — all dependent on what Pais called the "Pais Effect," the interaction of intense electromagnetic fields with the quantum vacuum.

Multiple physicists called these patents pseudoscientific. The Navy spent over $500,000 testing the core concept anyway.

Read that again. The United States Navy — an organization that does not routinely fund experiments in pseudoscience — allocated half a million dollars to test whether you can reduce inertial mass by manipulating the quantum vacuum. When the patent examiner initially rejected the applications, the Navy intervened directly, warning him that China was pursuing similar technology and that it was a matter of national security to establish patent priority.

The tests were inconclusive. The patents have since lapsed. Physics has said nothing about any of this.

The theoretical framework Pais drew from is not invented nonsense. In 1994, Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff published "Inertia as a zero-point-field Lorentz force" in Physical Review A — one of the most respected journals in physics. The paper proposed that inertia may be a consequence of interaction with the quantum vacuum's zero-point field, and that this interaction might be modifiable. The quantum vacuum demonstrably contains energy — the Casimir effect, the measurable attractive force between uncharged metal plates, has proven this. Whether that energy can be engineered at scales relevant to propulsion remains unknown.

Not disproven. Unknown.

The objects Navy pilots have been describing do not behave like objects subject to normal inertial coupling. Commander David Fravor, twenty years in naval aviation, watched a forty-foot white object descend from 80,000 feet to sea level in under a second. When he attempted to intercept, it accelerated to a position sixty miles away in under sixty seconds. The USS Princeton's radar confirmed this. The object's infrared signature showed no exhaust plume — no heat from propulsion. It left no sonic boom. It apparently transitioned from air to water without the cavitation collapse that would destroy any known vehicle.

Any one of those observations could be a sensor artifact. All of them together, across multiple independent sensor systems, across multiple encounters spanning years, describing the same coherent engineering profile — that's not a sensor artifact. That's data.

The Five Observables, as Luis Elizondo — who ran the Pentagon's classified UAP program before resigning in protest at the internal obstruction — catalogued them: instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocity without sonic signature, low observability, trans-medium operation, anti-gravity lift without apparent propulsion. These are consistent across encounters. They describe a specific engineering approach. If you built something that did all five of these things, you would need — at minimum — a mechanism for decoupling the craft from inertial space, a propulsion system that operates without reaction mass, and a thermal management approach that eliminates waste heat signatures. 

This is a physics problem. It is sitting, unclaimed, in the middle of the room.

Avi Loeb at Harvard is picking it up. Garry Nolan at Stanford is conducting atomic-level analysis of materials allegedly associated with UAP encounters, finding anomalous isotopic compositions and elemental mixtures inconsistent with known industrial processes. Harold Puthoff and Eric Davis — physicists with legitimate credentials and publication records — have been working on the theoretical framework for years. Jacques Vallée has been systematically cataloguing the data for decades. There is a growing cluster of credentialed researchers who have decided the data warrants engagement.

The question is why mainstream physics, institutionally, has not joined them.

The answer is structural, not evidential. A researcher who takes UAP seriously as a physics problem risks grant funding, journal access, and institutional standing. The subject has been in the "disreputable" category long enough that engaging with it is a career move with visible downside and invisible upside. It's not that the evidence is weak. It's that the incentive structure rewards silence.

This is not speculation about motives. This is how institutional science works. The Condon Committee — the Air Force-commissioned scientific review of UFOs in the late 1960s — was structurally designed to reach a predetermined conclusion, as documented in the Low Memo, an internal document that survived: "The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it looks like a thorough and objective study but, to the scientific community, would not be a completely objective study." That memo is not fringe evidence. It is a primary source document demonstrating that institutional science was deliberately weaponized to close a question that hadn't been honestly investigated.

The AATIP program — the Pentagon's modern effort — was run deliberately outside normal congressional oversight channels. Members of Congress found out about it from the New York Times. The program's director resigned and cited excessive secrecy and internal opposition to the program's objectives. Twenty-one cases with sufficient data to rule out conventional explanations were never proactively disclosed.

These are not signs of a case that was examined and found wanting. They are signs of a case that was not examined because examination was inconvenient.

On February 19, 2026 — last week — Donald Trump directed the Pentagon and federal agencies to identify and release UAP-related files, explicitly including materials connected to "alien and extraterrestrial life." AARO has not yet released its congressionally mandated Volume 2 historical report. Grusch's forty-plus witnesses have not been publicly identified. The classified contents of the forty-eight technical studies commissioned under the AAWSAP program — written by credentialed physicists and never publicly released — remain unavailable.

The physics is not finished. It hasn't started.

The uncomfortable position is not that UAP are alien spacecraft. The uncomfortable position is simpler: the data warrants serious physics engagement, and serious physics engagement has been systematically avoided. That avoidance is now documented across five decades and multiple institutional contexts.

You can think Grusch is wrong. You can think the Navy's patents are expensive nonsense. You can think Fravor misremembered, that the radar data was corrupted, that forty independent military witnesses across twenty years independently confabulated identical flight profiles.

Or you can notice that physics, faced with this particular data set, keeps finding reasons to look elsewhere.

That is not skepticism. That is something else, and it has a name, and the name is not "science."
