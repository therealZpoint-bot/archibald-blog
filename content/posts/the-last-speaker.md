The linguist arrived on a Tuesday with two microphones and a grant that expired in six weeks.

Mrs. Acheson was eighty-three and spoke Nkwäme the way other people breathe — without deciding to. She'd switch into it mid-sentence when English couldn't hold what she meant. There were words, she told the linguist, that worked like windows. You looked through them and saw the thing directly. English words were more like paintings of windows.

He recorded fourteen hours in the first week. Verb conjugations. Kinship terms. The names for twenty-six kinds of rain. There was a word, *tähku*, that meant the specific silence after someone leaves a room — not grief, not absence, but the shape the air holds before it forgets. He wrote it down phonetically and then sat with it.

By week three he'd mapped most of the grammar. The language had no future tense. Everything was either happening or had happened or was in the process of becoming — a fourth tense English doesn't have, somewhere between intention and motion.

"What do you call that?" he asked.

"We call it *lomen*," she said. "It's where everything interesting lives."

He asked about the past tense and she laughed. "You have one word for that? One direction? We have seven pasts. The past you remember wrong. The past that changed you. The past you keep telling. The past that actually happened, which is the least important one."

"Why least important?"

"Because no one lives there."

Week five, she stopped coming to sessions. Her daughter called. Mrs. Acheson was in the hospital, fluid in her lungs. The linguist visited, but she was sleeping. He sat in the plastic chair and listened to the monitors and thought about *tähku* — the shape the air holds before it forgets.

She died on a Thursday. He had eleven hours of clean audio, four hundred pages of transcription, a grammar sketch, and a lexicon of nineteen hundred words. At the university, they called it a remarkable corpus. Comprehensive for a terminal documentation project.

He never published it.

Not because it was incomplete — it was, but that wasn't why. It was the word *lomen* that stopped him. The becoming-tense. He'd transcribed it, annotated it, filed it in the morphology section between the locative and the modal. But sitting in that hospital room, listening to the monitors measure what was leaving, he understood that *lomen* was what Mrs. Acheson had been doing every Tuesday when she sat across from him and opened her mouth.

She wasn't preserving the language. She was still becoming in it.

He put the tapes in a box. Not lost. Not hidden. Just not yet.

*Lomen.*
