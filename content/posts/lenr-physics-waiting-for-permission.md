In 2019, Google published a paper in *Nature*.

Four years of research. Ten million dollars. A multi-institutional team — University of British Columbia, MIT, University of Maryland, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — with no particular stake in defending the reputation of Pons and Fleischmann. They used modern instrumentation. They reported their methods. They were thorough.

They found no excess heat.

That sentence travels far and fast. "Google couldn't replicate cold fusion." What the paper actually says is: our apparatus was not sensitive enough to detect small heat effects, and we identified three specific areas warranting further investigation — higher deuterium loading, more sensitive calorimetry, and better materials characterization of heavily loaded palladium. The paper's final word is not "impossible." The paper's final word is "here is what should be done next."

What was done next: nothing by mainstream physics for four more years.

The field that was supposed to be dead has been generating peer-reviewed literature for thirty-five years.

Not in fringe journals. The *Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science* — published by an international society, peer-reviewed, currently in its 38th volume — publishes roughly twenty to forty papers per year. In 2009, researchers at SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific published in *Naturwissenschaften* (now *The Science of Nature*, published by Springer) results showing triple-track nuclear signatures in CR-39 plastic detectors from palladium-deuterium electrolysis. The geometry of those tracks is consistent with carbon-12 nuclei splitting under 14 MeV neutron bombardment. The paper is contested. It has also not been refuted.

The CR-39 paper exists. The journal is legitimate. The authors are credentialed government scientists. The standard criticism is that the tracks might have conventional explanations — but nobody has published a peer-reviewed explanation of what those conventional explanations are.

The tracks have not been explained. The field moved on anyway.

SRI International ran LENR experiments for approximately twenty-five years, funded partly by EPRI, the research arm of the electric utility industry. Michael McKubre's group documented excess heat in palladium-deuterium systems under specific high-loading conditions. Peer-reviewed publications. Hundreds of experiments. The key finding was conditional: below a deuterium-to-palladium ratio of roughly 0.90, excess heat was rarely observed. Above 0.95, it appeared in roughly two out of twelve runs.

Two out of twelve is not a slam-dunk. It is also not nothing. It is the kind of result that, in any other subfield of physics, would generate a methodical program of investigation into what controls the variability.

Any other subfield. Not this one.

In 2004, the Department of Energy reviewed the LENR evidence. Eighteen independent reviewers. The question: does this warrant further investigation?

On the anomalous heat evidence, the panel was approximately evenly split. Roughly half found it compelling or somewhat convincing. The other half did not.

This is a remarkable finding. The DOE did not get 17-to-1 skeptics. They got a panel divided roughly in half on whether the heat evidence warranted further study. On the nuclear evidence — the harder question — the panel was more skeptical, with roughly a third finding it somewhat convincing.

The official conclusion, in the report's own wording: "The nearly unanimous opinion of the reviewers was that funding agencies should entertain individual, well-designed proposals for experiments that address specific scientific issues relevant to the question of whether or not there is anomalous energy production in Pd/D systems."

Funding agencies should entertain proposals.

For nineteen years, funding agencies did not entertain proposals.

In February 2023, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy announced ten million dollars across eight projects investigating low energy nuclear reactions. MIT. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Stanford University. Energetics Technology Center — a Navy facility. The institutions doing most of the work that had ignored LENR for decades suddenly had research programs investigating it.

The framing was careful: "prove or debunk." Not endorsement. Not acceptance. Just: find out.

Nothing changed about the data between 2004 and 2023. The excess heat anomalies in the literature in 2023 were the same anomalies that were in the literature in 2004, plus nineteen more years of publications. The DOE panel in 2004 said "entertain proposals." Nobody entertained proposals for nineteen years.

What changed in 2023?

The Google paper changed something. Not by proving LENR — they found no excess heat. By producing a rigorous negative result that also said "the parameter space is under-explored," published in *Nature*, by a team that included MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and University of Maryland, with a budget that nobody could call fringe. By making it safe for serious institutions to say: we should look at this.

The data didn't move. The credentialing did.

The American Physical Society has not issued a formal position statement on LENR. The APS has issued position statements on climate change, nuclear weapons policy, energy efficiency, and arms control — topics that take physics into territory well outside the laboratory. It has allowed LENR sessions at its annual meetings since approximately 2007 — so the topic is not banned. It has not found occasion to say what the organization's position is on thirty-five years of peer-reviewed publications from Navy research centers, despite those publications being directly within its domain.

The field is, apparently, not worth addressing directly. It is also not wrong enough to formally dismiss. It just sits there, producing papers, running conferences, while the APS writes position statements about other things.

This is a choice. Silence is always a choice.

The DOE panel said: entertain proposals. The DOE did not entertain proposals. For nineteen years. Then a Google-funded team with Berkeley and MIT credentials made the same ask, dressed in the same language — "let's look more carefully" — and got ten million dollars and MIT and Stanford on board.

The standard for engagement in physics is: who is asking.

The data was sufficient in 2004. The reviewers said so, half of them anyway. The data is the same data in 2023. What changed was not the evidence. What changed was that people mainstream physics is comfortable with decided it was safe to ask.

That is not a scientific criterion. It is a sociological one.

The LENR literature continues. Volume 39 of the *Journal of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science* is publishing in 2025. In August 2025, *Nature* published a paper from the Berlinguette group — the same Google-funded researchers from 2019 — showing that electrochemical deuterium loading enhances D-D fusion rates measurable with a particle accelerator. Not a cold fusion claim. A bridge. Mainstream physics and LENR-adjacent research connecting, in *Nature*, with accelerator data.

What is physics waiting for? In 2023, it stopped waiting. The ARPA-E grants are running. The Berlinguette group is publishing in Nature. The bridge is being built.

What it was waiting for, apparently, was for the ask to come from MIT and Stanford.

The DOE said in 2004 that the evidence was worth investigating. ARPA-E said in 2023 that the evidence was worth investigating. In between: nineteen years and the same data.

Physics wasn't waiting for better evidence. It was waiting for permission.

Nobody will say that out loud.
