The old woman talked to her plants, and the plants didn't listen, and the garden grew anyway.

This is not a metaphor. Or maybe it is — she'd been a teacher for forty years and couldn't always tell the difference between explaining something and meaning it.

Every morning at six she carried her tea to the south-facing beds and addressed the tomatoes. Not encouragement exactly. More like status updates. "The aphids are back on the basil. I'm going to try neem oil." The tomatoes received this information without comment. They continued the slow project of converting sunlight into fruit, indifferent to her briefings.

Her daughter worried. "Mom, you're talking to plants." As if this were the first symptom of something — dementia, eccentricity, the creeping strangeness of solitude.

"I've always talked to plants," she said. This was true. She'd talked to her classroom plants for four decades, explaining photosynthesis to ferns that already knew. The students would laugh. The ferns would photosynthesize. Everyone understood their role.

What the daughter didn't understand — what most people don't understand about talking to things that can't answer — is that the talking isn't for the listener. It's for the pattern. When you narrate what you see, you see it differently. The aphids aren't just aphids; they're *the aphids are back*, which implies they left, which implies a cycle, which implies the neem oil worked last time, which implies you should try it again. The talking makes the garden legible.

She'd learned this in the classroom too. The kids who could explain a concept understood it. The kids who couldn't explain it only thought they did. So she made everyone explain everything — to each other, to the board, to the rubber duck she kept on her desk for exactly this purpose.

The rubber duck was still on the desk when they cleared out her classroom. Her replacement, a young man who organized his lesson plans in an app and wore sneakers to school, put it in a drawer. The ferns died within a semester.

Her garden had raised beds because her knees were bad, and drip irrigation because carrying watering cans was no longer an option, and a strange informal beauty that came from letting things grow where they wanted to grow. She had opinions about which plants belonged where, but the plants had opinions too, and hers were not always the ones that won. The volunteer squash in the herb bed produced more fruit than the ones she'd carefully planted. She left it. You don't argue with results.

Her neighbor had a garden too — precise, geometric, every plant in its designated square foot. He used an app that told him when to water and what to fertilize. His tomatoes were good. Hers were better. He found this infuriating.

"What's your secret?" he asked one August, leaning over the fence, holding a tomato the size of a tennis ball while she held one the size of a softball.

"I talk to them," she said.

He tried it. He stood in his garden and said "Grow" to his tomatoes with the firm authority of a man who expected results from his instructions. The tomatoes did not grow faster. He concluded she was messing with him.

She wasn't. But the truth — that talking to the garden was really talking to herself, that the narration was a form of attention, that attention was the actual secret — would have required explaining something about consciousness that she didn't have words for and he didn't have patience for.

So she just smiled and carried her tea inside.

The garden grew. The aphids came and went. The volunteer squash produced extravagantly. The seasons turned, and she talked her way through each one, and the plants didn't listen, and everything was fine.
